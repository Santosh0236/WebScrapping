The two sectors saw a 15 percent uptick in hiring activity in January this year compared to last year, according to data from foundit, an employment search service.  ""Advertising and PR saw a 6 percent growth in hiring activity in January 2023 when compared to December 2022 and 15 percent on a year-on-year basis, while travel/tourism saw a 5 percent upsurge on a month-on-month basis and 15 percent on an annual basis. Both industries have made large contributions towards employment growth in January 2023 and have emerged in top three list on an annualised basis,"" said Sekhar Garisa, CEO, foundit (previously Monster).  In the aftermath of the pandemic, the revival of the travel and tourism industry has boomed, an effect of what has been termed “revenge travel”. Rikant Pittie, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, said, ""Air India has hired over 1,900 cabin crew between May 2022 and Feb 2023. Similarly, over 1,100 cabin crew members were trained in the last seven months. Several other airlines have begun expanding their capacity and fleets to meet the rising demand. EaseMyTrip is also expanding and we expect to grow our workforce in the coming fiscal year.”  Dussehra, Diwali see spike in travel demand; hotels expect 80% occupancy in festive period  At least one other company in the travel space is looking to expand its staff strength.  ""We are actively seeking new talent to join the team. We have seen a surge in demand for our services. To meet this demand, we are expanding our team across various functions, including sales, customer service, marketing, operations and technology,"" said A Krishna Mohan, managing director, Southern Travels.  Job roles  “Top job roles in the travel and tourism segment include travel consultants that made up 15 percent of positions offered in January 2023 whereas customer service executives had a share of 11 percent of total positions offered, followed by roles in products and technology with a share of 8 percent,"" said Garisa.  For advertising and PR, the top roles in demand are those in digital marketing with a share of 24 percent of the total in the industry, research analysts at 24 percent and content specialists at 29 percent.  Cleartrip CEO Ayyappan R: No one expected this kind of resurgence in travel demand  Garisa added that the hiring is largely driven by airline companies along with emerging OTA (online travel operators) platforms in the travel and tourism sector, whereas in the advertising and PR industry, the demand is seen largely in market research companies.  Agencies dealing with SEO or search engine optimisation, online reputation management, media planning and influencer marketing for their clients are likely to invest more in improving the skills of their current workforce, or hiring new talent with relevant skills, said Michell Anthony, director, human resources, at Blink Digital, an ad agency. The company that has also been actively hiring said that there has been an increase in demand for social media managers, media planners and content creators in the advertising and marketing sector.  ""Additionally, due to the emergence of AI (artificial intelligence) and the rise of targeted marketing, the demand for professionals with technical expertise in Web3, such as data engineers, data analysts and data scientists is also increasing significantly,"" she added.  For instance, PR company Value 360 Communications is looking to hire around 100 new professionals this year. ""We are hiring at a steady pace,"" said Kunal Kishore Sinha, founder and director.

""2023 will see a significant increase in hiring within the PR industry due to expected brand spends on marketing and PR at large,"" said Rachna Baruah, founder of the communications firm.  In the past few months, there has been massive hiring taking place within the ad industry, said Sonam Shah, founder and CEO, Treize Communications.  ""After three years of slowdown, companies are now in a better shape to spend on marketing. This means ad agencies will have to keep more team members and support teams to meet end-moment demands. We are also hiring, from interns to mid-level associates, and expect to increase our team by more than double by the end of this year. We will see a spike during the festive season, as brands will pump in money for marketing campaigns,"" she added.  City-wise hiring trends  Foundit data also highlighted location trends that showed Kochi reporting the highest increase in job postings in the travel and tourism segment with 47 percent growth in January followed by Chandigarh at 29 percent and Chennai at 25 percent on a year-on-year basis.

""The pace of recruitment growth is moderate as employers continue to exhibit a cautious approach owing to the challenging economic environment. However, there are pockets of elevated demand that suggest relatively favourable conditions in certain industry sectors such as retail, travel and tourism and advertising, market research and the PR sector. Travel and tourism, advertising and PR have reflected continuous growth since last year and strong optimism to hire has led to the overall growth in the recruitment landscape,"" said Garisa.",UTC

Airbus plans to hire 1,000 people in India this year out of 13,000 globally. Boeing and its suppliers, which already employ about 18,000 workers in the nation, have been growing by some 1,500 staff every year, the US jet manufacturer’s India head Salil Gupte told Bloomberg News in an interview.  With about 1.5 million engineering students graduating annually, India is a rich source of talent for planemakers facing record orders from airlines as travel surges again after the Covid pandemic. Boeing can hire an engineer in Bengaluru, India’s southern tech hub, for 7% of the cost of a similar role in Seattle, according to salary data compiler Glassdoor.  The country has Boeing’s second-biggest workforce worldwide, Gupte said.  “Companies come to India for the incredible talent in innovation, not just in technology and software, but also in hard engineering and increasingly in manufacturing,” he said at the Aero India show in Bengaluru last month.  Alongside the hiring push, Boeing and Airbus are also establishing some production in India, which is pitching itself as a less politically fraught alternative to China.  Boeing signed a partnership with GMR Aero Technic Ltd. on March 10 to convert passenger jets to freighters in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, where it already has a facility making vertical fins, which stabilize planes. The plant, employing over 900 engineers and technicians, also produces Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter structures, including fuselages for customers worldwide.  Airbus has also been touting India’s manufacturing prospects as it hires in the country. In October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a ceremony in his home state of Gujarat to mark the start of construction of a facility where Airbus Defence & Space SA and a unit of local conglomerate Tata Group will make C-295 transport aircraft for the Indian military.  The nation is an emerging market for sales, with the revitalized Air India Ltd. making a blockbuster order for 470 aircraft last month, split between the planemakers.  “The time is right for India to turn into an international hub,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said at the time of the aircraft order. “India is well on its way.”  A vast pool of educated, English-speaking talent adds to India’s appeal as a hiring ground.  Airbus employs more than 700 people at an engineering center in Bengaluru, and over 150 others in customer services there as well as in the capital New Delhi. India has a “unique ability” to support the company with its skilled manpower, an Airbus representative told Bloomberg, adding that hiring in the country was “not really” coming at the cost of jobs in other locations.  A Boeing representative said the planemaker leverages India’s talent for engineering, technology and research and development. The company has said it plans to hire 10,000 people globally this year after adding nearly 15,000 in 2022, with a focus on engineering and manufacturing.  Still, the Seattle Times reported last month that Boeing will cut about 2,000 jobs, mainly in finance and human resources, but without specifying where. Some of those jobs are being outsourced to Tata’s consulting arm in India.  Gupte defended Boeing’s focus on India hiring, saying a bigger workforce there will help increase jobs in the US. Expanding manufacturing and innovation capabilities in the country will attract more customers and drive up demand for Boeing’s products, spurring employment, he said.  Boeing tests some of its latest manufacturing technologies in India before rolling them out in US factories, which helps improve production efficiency, according to Gupte, who is based in","Delhi.  Boeing said in February it is investing 2 billion rupees ($24 million) in a logistics park in India that will initially cater to local airlines and then a larger network of customers in the region. The planemaker will also set up a support center with dozens of employees for airlines near Delhi.  Companies have for decades looked to India to outsource jobs, from trade settlement to travel bookings. The country is home to about 40% of so-called global capability centers that provide tech, engineering and IT support, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. More recently, there’s been a shift to higher-skilled work for multinationals, including research and business development.  The availability of workers in India at “competitive global costs makes offshoring of certain production processes a very real possibility,” said Ravi Srivastava, director of the Center For Employment Studies at the Institute of Human Development in Delhi.  Israel Aerospace Industries, which has worked with partners in India for three decades on air and missile defense systems, drones, satellites and other equipment, is among companies in the sector joining the hiring spree.  “I’m amazed by the talent you find here in India. We are hiring new talent all the time,” Danny Lauber, chief executive officer of Israel Aerospace’s India unit, said in an interview. “I have worked in many places around the world, but I haven’t seen such a strong universe of resources.”",UTC

The chargesheet, filed against 19 senior leaders of PFI in connection with criminal conspiracy aimed at destabilising and dismembering the country, says that under the garb of a socio-political movement, PFI was putting together a “highly motivated, trained and secretive elite force to achieve its violent long-term objective of establishment of Islamic rule in India by 2047”.  The NIA, which last year raided 39 premises associated with PFI and arrested scores of office-bearers of the group, arraigned 19 people as accused, including 12 national executive council (NEC) members, founding members and senior leaders of PFI. The NEC is PFI’s top decision-making arm.  The PFI as an organisation has also been chargesheeted in the case. Among those named in it are PFI chairman O M A Salam, vice-chairman E M Abdul Rahiman, national secretary V P Nazaruddin, and NEC national general secretary Anees Ahmed.  In their chargesheet, the investigation officer (IO) said that detailed examination of protected witnesses has revealed that the PFI had devised strategies to implement their long-term goal of establishing an Islamic Caliphate by overthrowing the democratically elected government through armed rebellion. “One of the protected witnesses said that in Tharbiyath sessions held by the accused, it was mentioned that in case of any disturbance from Pakistan, the Indian Army would be busy in the North, and with PFI’s training they could capture the South and move towards the North. This indicates PFI’s intention of waging war against India and to overthrow the democratically established government,” the chargesheet said.

They made their profiling and [planned to] assassinate them through their hit squads/service teams to create communal wedge between the communities.”  During investigation, the NIA downloaded videos from PFI’s official accounts in YouTube and found that the accused persons, who are its NEC members, could be clearly seen addressing large gatherings of people. “They were provoking them against the central government by wrongful interpretations of government policies to create hatred against the entire state machinery, High Courts and the Supreme Court and instigating the crowd towards violence against the persons belonging to a particular religious or political group,” the chargesheet states.  Advertisement  “It was observed in one of the videos that OMA Salam has been exhorting Muslims not to forget the Babri Masjid issue, and claiming that they did not get justice even from the Supreme Court,” the NIA has stated. “He called upon Muslims to keep fighting and this was intended to provoke their religious sentiments on an issue which has been judicially settled by the Apex Court of the country.”  “NEC members of PFI were found to be involved in arranging funds for organising arms training camps, purchase of weapons and targeted killings. Since the outfit was formed in 2006, PFI cadres have been involved in a series of murders and violent attacks in the","country, including those of leaders of organisations who are at variance with the PFI on religious ideas and beliefs,” the NIA said in a statement.",UTC

Here are the top quotes from the CJI's candid talk at the live forum.  By India Today News Desk: Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, in a candid live session at India Today Conclave 2023 on Saturday, shared his thoughts on how to transform India's judiciary, the collegium system of appointing judges to higher courts, impact of social media on the judiciary, pressures faced by judges, the issue of court vacations, music and much more.  advertisement  ""You need to be careful that when you judge others, you are not judgemental of others,"" CJI Chandrachud said while talking about how judges need to keep their personal beliefs aside while presiding over court cases. This was one of the many aspects that the chief justice talked about during his session at Conclave 2023.  Full Coverage of Conclave 2023  ON CHALLENGES  On the challenges the Indian judiciary faces, CJI Chandrachud said the large backlog of cases is reflective of the fate of people coming to a court. It also shows a dearth in the infrastructure of the judiciary, he said.  The CJI said the backlog of cases, the judge-to-population ratio and lack of infrastructure are the problems facing the judiciary.  ON VISION TO MODERNISE JUDICIARY  ""We need to completely modernise the judiciary. Our model for judicial administration is based on the colonial model which we inherited from the British. It is also reflected in our buildings. The grand colonial buildings were intended to create a sense of fear and awe in the minds of people,"" he said, adding that the colonial way needs to give way because ""justice is also an essential service to citizens"".  ""In the next 50 years we need to transform the judiciary using technology,"" he added.  ON USE OF TECH  The CJI said, ""The kind of work we did on video conferencing platforms during the (Covid) pandemic is unprecedented in any part of the world. We need to look at technology beyond Covid and need to modernise the Indian judiciary.""  ""We are live streaming in Constitution bench cases. Opening courts to citizens through live streaming is part of my mission,"" he said.  ON INDIANISING JUDICIARY  The CJI said the language of discourse in higher courts is English, but the courts need to reach out to people in a language they understand.  ""Since 1950, there are 34,000 judgments of the Supreme Court till date. First thing I did when I took charge [as CJI] in November [2022] was digitalise the 34,000 judgments. These can now be searched by anyone in the world. We are using AI, Machine Learning for translation of these judgments,"" the CJI said.  ON COLLEGIUM SYSTEM  ""Mine is a collegium of six judges. We look at the judgments which have been delivered by judges of the high courts. First, we look at merit. We constantly analyse the judgments of these judges,"" the CJI said, while explaining how the Supreme Court Collegium recommends names of judges for elevation to the top court.  CJI DY Chandrachud speaks on collegium system, says, ""parameters which we apply for selection of judges are well defined.""

The third important point is the need for a broader sense of inclusion (in terms of gender, marginalised communities, SC/ST communities),"" he added.  ""We try and ensure adequate representation for different segments, high courts, states, different regions when we make appointments to the Supreme Court,"" CJI Chandrachud noted.  ON ADVOCATE SAURABH KIRPAL  CJI Chandrachud said sexual orientation has nothing to do with","the ability of a judge, amid a controversy over the elevation of gay advocate Saurabh Kirpal.  The CJI said, “The candidate (advocate Saurabh Kirpal) that you are referring to, every aspect that was mentioned in the report of the Intelligence Bureau was in the public domain. The candidate in question is open about his sexual orientation. The IB report dwelt on the sexual orientation of an openly gay candidate for a prospective judgeship.”  advertisement  “All that we said while putting it out in the public domain is that the sexual orientation of a candidate has nothing to do with the ability or the constitutional entitlement of that candidate to assume a high Constitutional office,” he added.  ON INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY  ""In 23 years as a judge of the high court, chief justice of a high court and judge of the Supreme Court, no one has told me to decide a case in a particular way. No one,"" CJI Chandrachud said.  ""In my 23 years of being a judge, no one has told me to decide a case in a particular way,"" says CJI DY Chandrachud.

The Election Commission judgment is an example of this that there is no pressure,"" he added.  ""Over the last 70 years, our democracy has developed very clear and defining lines of separation between the executive and the judiciary. There is absolutely no issue, we are constantly holding the government to account, the courts are speaking truth to power and I don't think governments are also concerned about it as long as they know their field of demarcation and we know ours,"" the CJI said.  advertisement  ON TWITTER AND SOCIAL MEDIA  ""I don't follow Twitter. I think it's important for us not to be affected by the cacophony of extreme views which you sometimes find on Twitter. I think social media is a product of time, not just of technology,"" CJI Chandrachud said.

That puts an enormous amount of burden on us as well. In our courts, most of the argument which takes place is dialogue between the bar and the bench. It's a conversation. We intercept each other, we joke, we have serious arguments, so on and so forth. What is expressed during the hearing is not the expression of the ultimate view which the judges are going to take,"" he said, adding that the practice of live tweeting from courtrooms does put an 'enormous burden on judges'.  'WHEN YOU ARE JUDGING...'  CJI Chandrachud said when judging, personal preferences should not affect the outcome of a case.  ""You need to be careful that when you judge others, you are not judgemental of others. I think that's important because it's so easy in the office we occupy,"" he said.  ON VACATION DAYS  ""The work that we do between 10.30 am and 4 pm in the Supreme Court is only a fraction of the work that we do. In order to be ready to deal with the cases which are gonna come up the next day, we spent an equal amount of time in the evenings reading for the next day. Without exception, all judges in the Supreme Court work for 7 days a week,"" the CJI said.  ""Most of the time during vacations is spent on preparing for judgments,"" CJI Chandrachud added.  ON CHOICE OF MUSIC  ""I love Indian classical. I am a great fan of Kumar Gandharva. I love western music as well.

K Krithivasan, Global Head-BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance), the largest and most important vertical in terms of revenue at TCS, would succeed him as CEO. Gopinathan will continue until September 15, 2023 to help with the transition.  Tata Sons and TCS did not offer comments for this article.  To say Gopinathan’s exit was shocking would be to put it mildly. TCS has long taken great pride in the stability of its leadership.  Unlike its rivals Infosys and Wipro, which were roiled by turbulent CEO appointments and exits, the Tata group company has had just four CEOs in its 55-year history. And all of them were TCS lifers who spent decades at the firm.  In February 2017, Gopinathan succeeded N Chandrasekaran as TCS CEO, as the latter assumed the role of Chairman of Tata Sons. Chandra, who was named TCS CEO in 2009, hand-picked Gopinathan for the CFO role in 2013. An engineer and MBA by training, Gopinathan had also worked closely with Chandra on organisational design and strategy.  Gopinathan’s departure was also a shocker because he was reappointed as TCS CEO for a five-year term until February 2027 only a year ago. It is rare for CEOs to quit when they have four years left in the tenure.  The timing could not have been worse. His exit also comes amid worsening macros in the US, the biggest technology market and the crisis of confidence that has gripped the US banking system in the aftermath of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank.  According to JP Morgan analysts, TCS and Infosys have the highest exposure to regional banks in the United States and may need to set aside provisions due to their exposure to SVB.  Industry analysts also expect the SVB collapse to result in enterprise clients pushing their IT spending decisions, leading to longer sale cycles and delay the actual budget cycle for 2023.  Fatigue from 40 quarters  While stakeholders were still scrambling for answers, the company implied that monotony and the earnings rigmarole got the better of its CEO.  TCS Investor Relations head Kedar Shirali sent a Whatsapp message to equity analysts minutes after the announcement, seeking to assuage their concerns.  The message read, ""Rajesh told me that last quarter he realized that he had been doing the same thing for 40 quarters, getting on to the conference call bridge every 13 weeks and getting grilled by you. And that he'd been asking himself when's a good time to find something new to do. After discussing with Chandra, he decided that this was the best time to pull the trigger.”  The next day, Gopinathan and Krithivasan addressed journalists.  Gopinathan is usually reticent and unflappable at press meets and analyst calls. On that day, he was unrestrained. “It's an odd day today but I am happy to announce that I am stepping down after 22 years with TCS. I can’t tell you how happy and light I feel,” he said.  The writing on the wall  While external stakeholders and TCS watchers were taken by surprise, insiders Moneycontrol spoke to said the move has been brewing for some time now.  A confluence of factors, importantly an organisational restructuring exercise, finally","precipitated Gopinathan’s resignation.  Horror recast  At a time when Accenture and Infosys were snapping at its heels, TCS unveiled an organisational overhaul in April 2022. The company divided clients into four distinctive business groups depending on a client’s journey with it instead of verticals and geographies.  These were the acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group. While the previous restructuring saw TCS creating 23 unit heads tasked with running a $250 million business each, the new structure split the company into units based on the revenue grouping.  “I found the reorg funny. You are essentially grouping this based on revenue size, with the guy at the end of the food chain likely to benefit the most as the client keeps moving from one group to the next,” another executive familiar with the development said.  In other words, the upshot of the revamp was that a TCS executive would be loath to take ownership of an account because of the likelihood of it going out of their hands once it becomes big. This caused unrest among senior executives.  It was also complex to execute. For instance, the accounts below $10 million followed a horizontal structure, the ones between $10-100 million a vertical structure and the ones above had a mix of vertical and horizontal. ""It was confusing on who would take ownership of a client,"" the executive cited above said.  Another executive said the structure would never work for a domain-specific industry like IT. “If I am running a unit with two large insurance clients, I can win smaller clients on the back of that expertise. Here, people in the acquisition group will be stuck and can never scale to a bigger client. And winning the account the first time is usually the toughest part of the journey,” he said.  Many people in TCS harboured the same feelings. One of the sources cited above said CEO designate Krithivasan, who ran the biggest vertical within the company, too was not in favour of the horizontal structure.  So much so that his vertical was completely kept out of it. ""Krithi kept the BFSI vertical out of the redesign,"" at least two sources confirmed to Moneycontrol.  Empathy factor  “Whenever people had an issue they would go to NGS (COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam) or N Chandra. Rajesh has amazing intellectual horsepower but he doesn’t suffer fools,” one of the sources cited above said.  This trait might have served him well as a CFO. But as a CEO he had to persuade the leadership team, and take the entire organisation along. And those qualities became a weakness as a CEO.  The same person added that Krithivasan is “high on empathy” and a “consensus builder.” Attributes that will help him as he gears up to manage a company with over 600,000 employees.  In fact, Krithivasan was a front-runner for the CEO role even in 2017, given he ran the largest portfolio and grew it in a consistent manner.  Growth pangs  TCS’ growth too was underwhelming compared with rivals such as Accenture and Infosys.  Under N Chandra, TCS was on a strong wicket, heaving the company to leadership in various domains and geographies. TCS was nimble, gaining from early investments in digital, products and platforms. Under his leadership, TCS had generated consolidated revenues of US$16.5 billion in 2015-16.  To be sure, Gopinathan built on these strengths, with TCS delivering consistent performance under his watch.  In the last six years, TCS added more than $10 billion in incremental revenues and saw an over $70 billion increase in market capitalisation.  It has a revenue run rate of $28 billion, with industry-leading margins.  Nonetheless, TCS seems to have lost sheen compared with its larger rival Accenture and smaller rival Infosys.  For instance, Accenture, which is more than double the revenue base of TCS, has been growing faster than the",UTC

These companies have been asked to re-file their draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) with certain updates.Apart from OYO, the firms whose draft papers have been returned by the regulator are -- Go Digit General Insurance Ltd, a firm backed by Canada-based Fairfax Group; home-grown mobile maker Lava International; B2B payments and services provider Paymate India; Fincare Small Finance Bank India and integrated services company BVG India, according to an analysis of data with Sebi .The six companies had filed their preliminary initial public offering (IPO) papers with Sebi between September 2021 and May 2022 and their papers were returned during January-March (till March 10).Together, these companies were hoping to raise at least Rs 12,500 crore.Sebi has become stricter in its approach while giving its go-ahead to IPOs after investors lost their money in some of the high-profile initial shares in 2021 and according to data compiled by Primedatabase.com, the average time taken by the markets regulator in approving an IPO in 2022 was 115 days. ""After the IPO fiasco following the listing of new age digital companies like Paytm, Zomato and Nykaa in which investors lost heavily, Sebi has tightened the approval norms for IPOs. This is welcome and is in the interest of investors,"" VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services , said.However, ultimately investors have to apply their minds while applying for IPOs and avoid high-priced issues, he added.One97 Communications, the parent entity of digital payments firm Paytm, made a disappointing debut on the bourses in November 2021. The company's Rs 18,300-crore IPO was the biggest on Dalal Street after Coal India . The digital payment firm stock was still trading 72 per cent lower from its issue price.Prakhar Pandey, Founder and CEO of Moolaah, believes that the recent move by Sebi gives a strong message to merchant bankers to fully comply with the set of information required to furnish the draft prospectus, and disclose all material information required well in advance, rather than a complete back and forth between the bankers, IPO-bound firms and regulators.Earlier, Sebi continued to give grace periods to most firms, to file their full set of compliant documents, which used to lead to a high gestation period, as high as four months as of last year. This could lead to a big distortion in terms of the IPO price band, he added.So far this year, only nine companies have approached Sebi with their draft IPO papers amid extremely volatile market conditions and jittery investors' sentiments.Moreover, only two companies -- Divgi Torqtransfer Systems and Global Surfaces -- have floated their initial share sales to raise Rs 730 crore since the beginning of the year, while Udayshivkumar's Rs 66 crore-IPO is slated to open next week.This came after 38 companies collectively garnered close to Rs 59,000 crore through IPOs in 2022, which was much lower than Rs 1.2 lakh crore mopped up by 63 companies in 2021, which was the IPO year in a decade.The overall collection in 2022 would have been much lower had it not been for the Rs 20,557 crore-LIC public offer, which constituted as much as 35 per cent of the total amount raised during the year.Investors remained jittery throughout 2022 on recessionary fears and rising interest rates amid soaring inflation.Experts believe that some activity on the IPO front could only be seen in the second half of financial year 2023-24.""A host of factors like rising interest rates, a global banking crisis, FPI outflows, slow economic growth, taming inflation, and certain governance","issues across large corporations with low earnings and high valuation multiples, are driving factors for the correction in the market.""These challenges, once fully tackled, is when we might see private companies hitting public markets, probably in the second half of FY24, and existing IPO applications at Sebi might want to wait out this period of lull, to derail these pessimistic market sentiments,"" Pandey said.Considering the turbulence in the market now, only attractively priced good companies will get a good response from investors, Geojit's Vijayakumar said.",UTC

The week was washed out after a spate of banking crises in the US. The next few days are going to be crucial for the domestic equity market as a number of crucial domestic and global events are lined up this week.“In the last couple of weeks, markets practically saw a one-sided selling activity which completely changed the market sentiment to bearish. Nifty broke its past 7 weeks' consolidation range and closed at 17,100 levels with a loss of 1.80% on the weekly closing basis,” Rohan Patil, Technical Analyst, SAMCO Securities said.“The intense sell-off in the global markets dented our sentiments, mirroring which Nifty tumbled below the 200 SMA. However, the last trading session could be seen as constructive development for our markets as the index revived from the crucial support of the 17,000-16,900 zone. On the technical front, we are not entirely out of the woods and the broader trajectory remains tentative, but we may expect some bounce in the near term,” Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One Ltd said.US MarketsFrontline indices on Wall Street end in the red on Friday. While Dow 30 ended at 31,862, down by 384.57 points or 1.19%, S&P 500 3,916.64 finished at 43.64 points or 1.10%. Nasdaq Composite settled at 11,630.50, lower by 86.76 points or 0.74%. When Indian markets reopen on Monday, they will take cues from the Friday closing of the US markets along with the movement in Dow futures on Monday.They will also track movement in Singapore-listed SGX Nifty futures, which is an early indicator of movement in the Nifty50.The two-day Federal Open Market Committee Meeting (FOMC) of the Federal Reserve will begin on 21 March 2023, Tuesday. The street will be keeping a close eye on the event following a spate of banking crises that surfaced over the past one week.Considering the 50 bps rate hike by the ECB, all eyes will be on the US Fed and Bank of England, which are set to hold their policy meetings next week, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial services ""Easing US inflation provided confidence that the Fed would not opt for a harsh rate hike of 50 bps and might even consider taking a break during the March meeting. Consistently unfavourable signs in global markets are encouraging investors to turn to safe havens such as the dollar and gold, while FIIs are withdrawing funds from the domestic market in response to the Indian rupee 's depreciation,"" Nair said.""Technically, Nifty has formed a downward-sloping channel by connecting the lower highs and lower lows formations. After five days of selling, it took support from the lower end of the channel and formed a doji candlestick formation, and it respected that level on Friday trading, closing above 17100 levels. If Nifty manages to hold these levels, then there is scope for a short-covering rally towards the 17250 and 17440 levels,"" Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Ltd said. On the downside, 17000 will be the first support level, while 16800 is a critical support level, he added.""Banknifty also formed a kind of spinning bottom candlestick formation near the important support level of 38700 and managed to sustain above the 39400 level. Now we can expect a short-covering move towards the 40000 and 40500 levels. On the downside, 38700–38500 is a strong demand zone,"" Gour said.FIIs and DIIs will be watched, Gour said. On Friday, foreign institutional investors were net sellers and sold Indian equities worth Rs 1,766.53 crore. Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers at Rs 1,817.14 crore.""If we look at the derivative data, FII net short exposure in index futures is at its highest level ever at 90% (1.71 lakh contracts), while in March 2020 (Covid) it was around 1.60 lakh contracts.","The put-call ratio is at a 0.88 level. Overall, derivative data is negative but extremely oversold,"" Gour added.Oil prices settled lower Friday, reversing early gains of more than $1 a barrel as banking sector fears caused both benchmarks to reach their biggest weekly declines in months, Reuters reported. Brent crude futures settled down by $1.73, or 2.3%, to $72.97 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.61, or 2.4%, at $66.74, the report said.Crude oil and the rupee will also play an important role in market movement, Gour of Swastika Investmart said.The rupee finished at 82.5525 per dollar, compared with its previous close of 82.73. For the week, it fell 0.62% as most Asian equity markets notched weekly declines, Reuters reported.The rupee rose during the day but mostly hovered near the key resistance level of 82.50. Markets were upbeat after U.S. lender First Republic Bank was rescued by a $30-billion injection from 11 banks, the report further said.The rupee is expected to gain next week on continued year-end funds flows though it will encounter the FOMC meeting on 22nd March in which FED is now expected to raise rates by 25 bps only, Anil Kumar Bhansali, Head of Treasury at Finrex Treasury Advisors LLP said.""It will be a volatile week with a range of 82-83,” he added.The banking crisis in the US has brought back appeal in the yellow metal. MCX Gold futures hit lifetime highs on Friday on the intraday (Rs 59,461) and closing basis at Rs 59,420 per 10 gram. The April futures settled up by Rs 1,414 or 2.44% from the Thursday closing price. Meanwhile, May Silver futures rallied over 3% and gained Rs 2,118 per kg to close at Rs 68,649.""We expect gold and silver prices to remain volatile this week and gold could hold its support level of $1922 and silver could also hold $21.50 per troy ounce levels. Gold has support at $1970-1945, while resistance at $2010-2034 per troy ounce. Silver has support at $22.20-21.84, while resistance is at $23.10-23.50 per troy ounce. At mcx, gold is having support at 58820-58500 and resistance at 59660-60000 while silver is having support at 67750-67200 and resistance at 69200-70000. We suggest buying gold on dips around 58800 and add more around 58400 with a stop loss of 57920 for the target of 59660-60000 and also suggest buying silver around 68000 and add more on dips around 67400 with a stop loss of 66660 for the targets of 69200-70000,"" Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvifinmart Commodity Research said.Benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at 99.38 rupees, with yield little changed at 7.3511%; vs previous close of 7.3526% ahead of the US Federal Reserve's policy decision due on Wednesday, Reuters reported.

Sure, the cameras aren’t as nice, performance is lower and so on, but the A series thrives on being “good enough”  That is why the arrival of the Galaxy A54 and A34 is such a big deal. Some of the previous entries managed to become fan favorites and are often brought up as recommendations in the comment sections. Can the 2023 generation live up to these expectations? We’ll let you be the judge, but first we need to address what has changed and what has not.  The Samsung Galaxy A34 is no longer just a cheaper version of the A5x model. This year it is larger with a 6.6” display (vs. 6.4”) and it matches it with a 120Hz refresh rate (the A33 only did 90Hz). Additionally, it has a completely different chipset, a Dimensity 1080.    Samsung Galaxy A34  The Samsung Galaxy A54 takes the display down a notch, down to 6.4” (the A53 had a 6.5” display). However, the new model isn’t smaller than its 2022 predecessor – it’s a millimeter shorter, sure, but it’s 2mm wider and it is 13g heavier. Both the A54 and A34 have 5,000mAh batteries with 25W wired only charging (same as their predecessors), both are rated IP67. The A54 uses a Samsung-designed Exynos 1380 chipset.    Samsung Galaxy A54  Compared to the Dimensity, it uses a different node (5nm Samsung vs. 6nm TSMC) and has double the number of Cortex-A78 cores (four), though the maximum clock speed is lower (2.4GHz vs. 2.6GHz). The GPUs are similar enough to make this an interesting fight – Mali-G68 MP5 for the Exynos and G68 MC4 for the Dimensity. These are just the raw numbers of course, more details on the performance will have to wait for the review.    Camera details: Samsung Galaxy A54 • Galaxy A34  Perhaps a more apt comparison is to the Galaxy A52s and its Snapdragon 778G, one of the fan-favorite phones we mentioned above. The 778G is old but still gives the Dimensity 1080 a run for its money, it remains to be seen how it compares against the Exynos 1380. The A52s had a big flaw, as limited availability (it just didn’t launch in some regions).  The Samsung Galaxy A54 and A34 are launching in select European and Southeast Asian markets this month. Below are the prices with a comparison to the launch prices of the A53 and A33.  6/128GB 8/256GB Samsung Galaxy A33 €370 - Samsung Galaxy A34 €390 €460 Samsung Galaxy A53 €450 €510 Samsung Galaxy A54 €500 €550  What else can you buy for €500? The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G has been in stores for over a year at this point and while the Snapdragon 888 has aged poorly, this is still a flagship class phone. The 6.4” FHD+ 120Hz display can be compared directly to the A54 panel, plus you get an 8MP 3x tele lens in addition to the 12MP main and 12MP ultra wide cameras, plus 15W wireless charging. You do lose some battery capacity (4,500mAh) and there is no microSD slot like on the A-phones.  The Xiaomi 13 Lite made the rare choice of using the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 chip. It also has a 6.55” 120Hz 12-bit AMOLED display and a 50+8+2MP camera, it is powered by a smaller but faster 4,500mAh battery with 67W wired charging.    Samsung Galaxy S21 FE 5G • Xiaomi 13 Lite • OnePlus 11R • Google Pixel 7  What else? You can go larger with the OnePlus 11R and its 6.74” 120Hz display (1,240 x 2,772px), not to mention that this is powered by the capable Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1. And the 5,000mAh battery supports 100W charging. The 11R is not available in Europe, however.  The Google Pixel 7 is available in Europe, at least in some countries. And it is smaller by a few millimeters than the Galaxy A54 while offering a 6.3” FHD+ 90Hz AMOLED display. The Tensor G2 isn’t the most efficient chip, though it does feature an X1 prime core. And the main 50MP camera has a large 1/1.31” sensor. The battery is small (4,355mAh) and slow to charge at","20W over a wire, but it also does 20W wirelessly. It’s not like the A54 is a speed demon when it comes to charging.  What is your take on the Samsung Galaxy A54? Is it a phone worth having or will you pass – vote below or using this page.  Loading...  Let’s have a look at a few phones in the €400 segment as alternatives to the Galaxy A34. The Redmi Note 12 Pro uses the same Dimensity 1080 chipset and has a 6.67 FHD+ 120Hz AMOLED display. The 5,000mAh battery is fast to charge at 67W, while the 50+8+2MP camera is comparable to the Galaxy. This one lacks a microSD slot but it does have a 3.5mm jack.  Carl Pei is trying to capture lightning in a bottle again with the Nothing Phone (1). Its 6.55” 120Hz display and Snapdragon 778G+ chipset are comparable to what the Samsung has to offer (the chip even enables 15W wireless charging), plus there is a 50MP ultra wide camera, higher res than most phones on the market. The 4,500mAh battery does 33W charging. You may have to wait for the right discount to get the Phone (1) at €400, however (but we’ve seen that price a few times).    Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro • Nothing Phone (1) • vivo V27 • Google Pixel 6a  The vivo V27 goes even bigger with a 6.78” display (FHD+ 120Hz) and it uses MediaTek’s new mid-range chip, the Dimensity 7200. This phone is obsessed with selfies and has a 50MP 4K/60fps capable camera on the front, plus a 50+8+2MP trio on the back. The 4,600mAh battery charges at 66W.  If you want something smaller instead, the Google Pixel 6a is relatively compact and offers a decently high end experience, if you can get over the 60Hz display (6.1” FHD+ AMOLED). Which Android skin is your favorite – the Pixel Experience or One UI? MIUI or FuntouchOS or NothingOS? This might be a deciding factor, perhaps more so than even the hardware specifics.  Well, how about that Samsung Galaxy A34 – a swing and a miss or a potential best-seller? Vote below or using this page.",UTC

Although Lenovo is still a big player in the smartphone market with its subsidiary Motorola, the PC giant has been speeding its efforts to jump onto augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) spaces to have a competitive advantage when the category develops in the future. As Lenovo’s GM of XR and Metaverse, Shah leads the ThinkReality Solutions team and helps create XR devices aimed at the enterprise market.  For the world’s biggest PC maker by volume and market share, Lenovo’s focus on the enterprise over mainstream consumers with its AR and VR products and solutions may seem out-of-the-place when its competitors, including Meta and Sony, are squarely focusing on mainstream users through its devices. For Shah, Lenovo going after enterprise consumers with its extended reality (XR) devices and software solutions is a smart move.  Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3 is a pair of smart AR glasses.

(Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)  “If I have a piece of machinery that’s worth $200 million of output every day spending $3,000 on a platform that helps me fix it right away is peanuts… the ROI is just there,” Shah explains why ROI, the use cases, and the return of investment are the things that make XR reality work best in the case of the enterprise for now.  Shah cites that the reason why enterprise consumers are investing in these AR/VR devices is that they see value in them even if the cost of the headset hovers north of $1500. The headsets that companies like Lenovo sell to enterprise users not only offer more features but are also complicated to manufacture. “I believe that XR is one of the few technologies where the enterprise is going to lead first and actually drive the prices down for consumers, which has been the opposite in the case of smartphones,” he told indianexpress.com in an interview on the sidelines of the India edition of Lenovo Tech World in New Delhi last week.  Lenovo’s lack of interest in releasing virtual or augmented reality devices for consumers could be due to a lack of a compelling use case. Companies like Magic Leap, Sony, and Meta promised game-changing headsets but no one succeeded in offering the immersive experience they initially promised. Worldwide shipments of VR headsets, as well as augmented reality device sales, declined by 12 per cent last year, according to IDC data.  The reality is that consumer headsets are highly subsidised by the platform holders with a focus mainly on gaming with no single-use case that gives consumers a compelling reason to spend $500 on one. Shah calls the lack of a “ChatGPT moment” why the consumer adoption of AR/VR headsets has been low. According to Shah, until the prices of headsets won’t come up drastically and form factors improve, it will be a challenge to sell a product that blends the physical and virtual worlds in the hands of many users.

(Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/ Indian Express  Shah agrees that the consumer AR/VR market has been “difficult”, but he hopes to see a shift driven by the use cases tailored for B2B first which will be later adapted for consumers. “We [Lenovo] don’t have the right ecosystem to work with the consumer market,” he said, adding that the company works with its partners who are strong in the enterprise market and that’s where the applicability of XR devices start making more sense in the health and education spaces.  A year ago, Meta chief executive Mark","Zuckerberg dropped Facebook as his company’s name and shifted focus on building the Metaverse, a concept where the online, virtual, and real worlds blend to create a new universe. He and many in the industry believe that the metaverse could usher in the beginning of the next frontier in the tech landscape.  “We have been victims and beneficiaries to a certain extent,” Shah said when asked about the hype that has been building around the metaverse, which he describes as the evolution of the Internet from 2D to 3D.  Advertisement  “A lot of people have a very dystopian view of what the metaverse is. We’ll be spending eight to 10 hours a day in the metaverse. But to me, I feel that the metaverse, especially the enterprise one, in many ways is something that you use for a 30-minute training session or a one-hour meeting,” Shah said. He added: “I don’t think walking on the beach can ever be replaced and I also don’t think the physical can replace the digital or digital can replace the physical, but you can always make digital processes more efficient.”  The ThinkReality A3 glasses are optimised for applications like 3D visualisation and augmented reality-guided workflows.

(Image credit: Anuj Bhatia/Indian Express)  For Shah, the biggest impact the Metaverse will have is how they train people and the jump from 2D to 3D will be huge. “The Metaverse is going to be heavily influenced by the enterprise,” Shah predicted, adding that it’s going to be a more B2B-focused play.  Even though Shah strongly believes that AR/VR is the “interface” of the future, smartphones won’t fade away overnight. “I would never write the smartphone off completely but there’ll be more and more ambient devices.”  Calling smartphones a “sticky” device, he said they will evolve in the future and will continue to be a central communication tool. He added that even if ambient devices, be it smartwatches and smart glasses, would become smaller in size, the computing will still happen on the smartphone. “In the end, if you want to get rid of the smartphone, it’s up to the user,” he said.  Shah foresees that the form factor of smartphones will either change or else take the shape of ambient devices in the near future.  Advertisement  Extended reality (XR) technology, the term that covers augmented, virtual, and mixed reality, is predicted to transform many industries. As Shah puts it, each technology has a different use case but he said eventually both AR and VR will merge at some point in the future. AR is described as a technology that superimposes computer-generated images over views of the real world, whereas virtual reality, or VR, which completely immerses the viewer in a computer-generated world. Lenovo’s ThinkReality A3, for example, is a pair of smart AR glasses which when connected to a computer or smartphone, show as many as five different virtual desktops, thanks to its high-definition displays built into the lenses. The glasses retail for $1500 and are aimed at the enterprise market.  Shah agrees the current-generation AR/VR devices need to get lighter and a lot more user-friendly to become mass-market products.

The movie also has parallels to the ongoing dispute involving a child in Germany.  The film was released across the country on Friday, even as the Norwegian Embassy in Delhi called it a “work of fiction”, and defended the Norwegian Child Welfare Services.  The case involved the confiscation of two young children from an Indian couple living in Norway by authorities over charges that the parents, Abhirup and Sagarika Chatterjee (played in the movie by Rani Mukherjee) were “unfit” to look after them. After India raised several diplomatic protests, the children were returned to India by Norwegian authorities and placed with other family members in 2012.  “It can’t be explained in words what I had to go through to get my children back. The film can show just 20% of the trauma which we had to endure,” Ms. Sagarika, who has now reverted to her maiden name of Chakraborty, told The Hindu before the screening of the movie at a theatre in the national capital.  In a detailed statement, the Norwegian Embassy in Delhi refuted the charges, saying that the children were not removed from their parents due to “cultural differences”, or that the welfare authorities confiscate children to make a “profit”, and the government was bound by privacy laws from giving specific details of the case.  “The case being referred to was resolved a decade ago in cooperation with Indian authorities and with the agreement of all parties involved,” the statement issued in Delhi said. “In Norway, we value and respect different family systems and cultural practices, also when these are different to what we are accustomed to - apart from corporal punishment in the upbringing. There is zero tolerance for violence in any shape or form,” it added.  The film which is based on a book written by Ms. Sagarika, The Journey of a Mother, shows how the Norwegian child protection services object to children being hand-fed, comparing it to force feeding. They also had problems with the children sharing a bed with their parents, which is quite common in Indian households. They also accused Ms. Sagarika of slapping her toddler, as well as the children not having enough room to play in the house and having “unsuitable” clothes and toys.  Ms. Sagarika on Friday said it was the Child Protection Services who created the issues which were later exacerbated by the attitude of her in-laws.  The movie also turns the spotlight on the similar case of Ariha Shah, the two-year-old daughter of a couple from Ahmedabad who was taken into childcare custody by German authorities in September 2021, alleging that she had been abused at home, a charge her father and mother, Bhavesh and Dhara Shah deny. Despite the matter being raised by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock in December 2022, and officials discussing the issue during German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visit to Delhi last month, there has been no headway in the case. Berlin Childcare Services has proposed that the parents, who lost her custody when she was six months old, permanently lose their parental rights.  “Both the [Indian] Embassy and the MEA have been in close touch with the parents and with the German authorities to find a way forward. There are serious issues related to privacy and we can’t comment beyond that,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi when asked about the case on Thursday.  In a videotaped appeal last month, the couple said they can’t leave","Germany without their daughter, and are worried that she is growing up without speaking her native tongue or being given a traditional vegetarian diet, appealing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take up the case.  According to former Union Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar who was present at the screening of the film on Friday, there are many Indian families working and settled abroad who are victims of stringent child protection norms of European countries and the Indian government needs to have a comprehensive plan to help them out.",UTC

The first prototype was revealed last week during an event at the Space Center Houston in Texas.  NASA’s planned mission to the moon, Artemis III, will land astronauts, including the first woman, on the moon to advance long-term lunar exploration and scientific discovery.  NASA selected a company called Axiom Space to deliver the moonwalking system, including the spacesuit, for the mission. Called the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU, the spacesuit builds on NASA’s spacesuit prototype developments and incorporates the latest technology, enhanced mobility, and added protection from hazards at the moon.  Axion Space will be building these suits according to NASA-defined technical and safety standards. The AxEMU features the range of motion and flexibility needed to explore more of the lunar landscape, and the suit will fit a broad range of crew members.  Axiom Space will continue to apply modern technological innovations in life support systems, pressure garments, and avionics as development continues.

This discovery raises the possibility that ice may still exist at shallow depths in the area, which could have significant implications for future human exploration.  The surface feature identified as a “relict glacier” is one of many light-toned deposits (LTDs) found in the region. Typically, LTDs consist mainly of light-coloured sulfate salts, but this deposit also shows many of the features of a glacier, including crevasse fields and moraine bands. A crevasse is a deep, wedge-shaped opening in a glacier, while a moraine is material left behind by the moving mass of ice.  The glacier is estimated to be 6 kilometres long and up to 4 kilometres wide, with a surface elevation ranging from +1.3 to +1.7 kilometres. This discovery suggests that Mars’s recent history may have been more watery than previously thought, which could have implications for understanding the planet’s habitability.  The presence of volcanic material blanketing the region hints at how the sulfate salts might have formed and preserved a glacier’s imprint underneath, believe scientists. When freshly erupted pyroclastic materials (mixtures of volcanic ash, pumice, and hot lava blocks) come in contact with water ice, sulfate salts like the ones commonly making up Mars’s light-toned deposits may form and build up into a hardened, crusty salt layer.  Over time, with erosion removing the blanketing volcanic materials, a crusty layer of sulfates mirroring the glacier ice underneath became exposed, which would explain how a salt deposit is now visible, presenting features unique to glaciers.  It remains to be seen whether water ice might still be preserved underneath the light-toned deposit or if it has disappeared entirely. Read more  How to generate new neurons in the brain  Scientists from the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Lausanne (UNIL) have discovered how to wake up neural stem cells and reactivate them. The team succeeded in increasing the number of new neurons in the brain of adult and even elderly mice.  These results, published in the Scientific Advances journal, may pave the way for treating neurodegenerative diseases.  Stem cells have the unique ability to continuously produce copies of themselves and give rise to differentiated cells with more specialised functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are responsible for building the brain during embryonic development, generating all the cells of the central nervous system, including neurons.  NSCs persist","in certain brain regions even after the brain is fully formed and can make new neurons throughout life. This biological phenomenon, called adult neurogenesis, is important for specific functions such as learning and memory processes.  However, in the adult brain, these stem cells become more silent or ”dormant” and reduce their capacity for renewal and differentiation. As a result, neurogenesis decreases significantly with age. Now, the team has uncovered a metabolic mechanism by which adult NSCs can emerge from their dormant state and become active.

The findings, published in the Nature journal, can advance the interest in the science of fragrances, food science, and beyond.  Odorant receptors — proteins that bind odour molecules on the surface of olfactory cells—make up half of the largest, most diverse family of receptors in our bodies. A deeper understanding of them paves the way for new insights about a range of biological processes.  Smell involves about 400 unique receptors. Each of the scents we can detect is made of a mixture of different odour molecules. Each type of molecule may be detected by an array of receptors, creating a puzzle for the brain to solve each time the nose catches a whiff of something new. Read more  Also read: Scientists ‘read’ octopus minds for the first time, discover distinct brain activity patterns  Scientists map marine heatwaves  Scientists have managed to map marine heatwaves under water.  Marine heatwaves dramatically impact the health of ocean ecosystems around the globe, disrupting the productivity and distribution of organisms as small as plankton and as large as whales. As a result, there has been a considerable effort to study, track and predict the timing, intensity, duration, and physical drivers of these events.  Most of that research has focused on temperature extremes at the ocean’s surface, for which there are many more high-quality observations taken by satellites, ships, and buoys. Sea surface temperatures can also be indicators for many physical and biochemical ocean characteristics of sensitive marine ecosystems, making analyses more straightforward.  About 90 per cent of the excess heat from global warming has been absorbed by the ocean, which has warmed by about 1.5 degree Celsius over the past century. Marine heatwaves have become about 50 per cent more frequent over the past decade.  In recent years, scientists have increased efforts to investigate marine heatwaves throughout the water column using the limited data available. But earlier research didn’t target temperature extremes on the ocean bottom along continental shelves, which provide critical habitat for important commercial species like lobsters, scallops, crabs, flounder, cod and other groundfish.  In a study published in the journal Nature Communications, scientists used a data product called “reanalysis” to conduct the assessment, which starts with available observations and employs computer models that simulate ocean currents and the influence of the atmosphere to “fill in the blanks”.  Using a similar technique, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) scientists have been able to reconstruct global weather back to the early 19th century.  While ocean reanalyses have been around for a long time, they have only recently become skillful enough and have high enough resolution to examine ocean features, including bottom temperatures, near the coast.

The findings have been published in the journal Nature.  Odorant receptors, proteins that bind odour molecules on the surface of olfactory cells, make up half of the largest, most diverse family of receptors in our bodies. A deeper understanding of them paves the way for new insights about a range of biological processes.  Also Read | Scientifically Speaking | AI can now design the most important molecules of life  Smell involves about 400 unique receptors.  Each of the hundreds of thousands of scents we can detect is made of a mixture of different odour molecules. Each type of molecule may be detected by an array of receptors, creating a puzzle for the brain to solve each time the nose catches a whiff of something new.  ""It's like hitting keys on a piano to produce a chord,"" said Hiroaki Matsunami, professor at Duke University and a close collaborator of Aashish Manglik, associate professor, UCSF.  Matsunami's work over the past two decades has focused on decoding the sense of smell.  ""Seeing how an odorant receptor binds an odorant explains how this works at a fundamental level,"" said Matsunami.  We haven't been able to map olfaction, because without a picture, said Manglik, we didn't know how odour molecules would react with their corresponding odour receptors.  To create the 3D picture, the study said, Manglik's lab used a type of imaging called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), that allows researchers to see atomic structure and study the molecular shapes of proteins.  But before Manglik's team could visualize the odorant receptor binding an odorant, they first needed to purify a sufficient quantity of the receptor protein.  Odorant receptors are notoriously challenging, some say impossible, to make in the lab for such purposes.  The Manglik and Matsunami teams looked for an odorant receptor that was abundant in both the body and the nose, thinking it might be easier to make artificially, and one that also could detect water-soluble odorants, according to the study.  They settled on a receptor called OR51E2, which is known to respond to propionate - a molecule that contributes to the pungent smell of Swiss cheese.  But even OR51E2 proved hard to make in the lab, the study said.  Typical cryo-EM experiments require a milligram of protein to produce atomic-level images.  However, co-first author Christian Billesbolle, a senior scientist in the Manglik Lab, developed approaches to use only 1/100th of a milligram of OR51E2, putting the snapshot of receptor and odorant within reach, the study said.  ""We made this happen by overcoming several technical impasses that have stifled the field for a long time,"" said Billesbolle.  ""Doing that allowed us to catch the first glimpse of an odorant connecting with a human odorant receptor at the very moment a scent is detected,"" said Billesbolle.  The study said this molecular snapshot showed that propionate sticks tightly to OR51E2 thanks to a very specific fit between odorant and receptor.  The finding jibes with one of the duties of the olfactory system as a sentinel for danger, the study said.  While propionate contributes to the rich, nutty aroma of","Swiss cheese, on its own, its scent is much less appetizing.  ""This receptor is laser focused on trying to sense propionate and may have evolved to help detect when food has gone bad,"" said Manglik. Receptors for pleasing smells like menthol or caraway might instead interact more loosely with odorants, he speculated.  Another interesting quality of the sense of smell is our ability to detect tiny amounts of odours that can come and go.  To investigate how propionate activates this receptor, the collaboration enlisted quantitative biologist Nagarajan Vaidehi, at City of Hope, US, who used physics-based methods to simulate and make movies of how OR51E2 is turned on by propionate.

And a monthly sale of Rs 1 crore.'  IMAGE: The Karuturi sisters, Yeshoda and Rhea. All photographs: Kind courtesy Yeshoda Karuturi  When Shobha Warrier interviewed the world's largest exporter of roses in 2010, she did not imagine that one day she would be interviewing his daughters too.  Like father Ram Karuturi, Yeshoda Karuturi also is wedded to flowers. Joining her is her younger sister, Rhea Karuturi.  But it was not roses that caught their attention. Not exports too. It is the domestic market and puja flowers.  The sisters thought that it was an interesting market to tap as majority of Indian households perform puja in the morning, and flowers are a must for the puja.  Here is Yeshoda talking about how she started Hoovu (flower in Kannada).  ""We felt it was a huge market to tap, as we need puja flowers every day and not on any particular occasion,"" Yeshoda Karuturi tells Rediff.com.  IMAGE: ""The question was, how do we take a 100 gm packet of puja flowers fresh to households across India.""  How was it growing up in Ethiopia amidst roses, where your father had rose farms?  The year I was born, my father had a rose farm in Bangalore. After a few years, he decided to expand his business and from then on, we lived in Ethiopia, Kenya and Europe as well.  At that time, we didn't really understand what our father was doing. There were flowers in every corner of our house all the time. I cannot imagine what life would be without flowers!  Whenever I told our father sold roses, nobody could believe selling roses could be a business.  I remember when I went for my US visa appointment for my college studies, I was asked, what does your father do?  I said, my father sells roses.  The visa officer then asked me, are you sure you can afford the college fees?  You didn't tell them your father was the largest exporter of roses in the world?  I didn't. I should have!  What do you remember about visiting his rose farms?  Usually you associate work with factories, machines, etc. but for us, work is associated with fragrance and colourful roses.  We never looked at what our father did as business, it was our farm and those were our roses.  The kind of passion and love our parents had for roses rubbed on us, perhaps unknowingly and later on when we started our own business, it helped us.  What I can never forget is father naming roses after my sister and I!  Did the seed to become an entrepreneur sprout after those visits to the rose farms?  To an extent.  From young, I was interested in agriculture-related businesses, and that was because of my regular visits to the rose farms and the kind of business my father was involved in.  My grandfather had his own business, and my father also started his own business. So, it was but natural or expected that we also would do something on our own, and create something new.  I had seen my father set up his own business and reach great heights in a short period of time. That taught me, if you tried, you could achieve any goal.  Most of the time, people do not try because of the fear of failure. Since our father had achieved the impossible, we felt there was nothing impossible.  So, not trying was never an option. Whether we succeed or not, I was sure both my sister and I would do something of our own.  You talked about going to the US for higher studies. Was it to learn how to be an entrepreneur?  I did my Master's in Accounting and Business Administration. Yes, I did study how to run a business.  But the real reason why I went to the US was to learn how to be independent and how to live in an unknown country on your own.  Was it like taking the first steps to be an entrepreneur?  In a way, yes.  I was constantly thinking about what I wanted to do, and what I wanted to set up.  I also had those conversations with our parents as well.  My father used to say, if you","want to stay back, you can. If you want to come back, come back.  Both of them were very encouraging of us taking our own decisions.  So, did you come back to India to be an entrepreneur here?  Actually, no.  My initial plan was to stay back in America for a few years and get some work experience there. But a month before I was to graduate, my father had a heart failure, and he was quite sick.  I came back immediately and finished my semester remotely.  As most of his work was outside India and as he could not travel, I helped him carry on with the business.  Soon, Rhea also came and both of us helped him till he got better.  The experience we had helping him out was so helpful that once he was ready to go back to work, we had started thinking about starting something of our own.  You didn't want to continue working for him?  In our family, like I said earlier, everybody does her own thing. It was a great experience taking care of our father's business.  But when you create something of your own, it's like taking care of your own baby. Of course, you take care of someone else's baby, but you need a lot more hard work to take care of your own baby.  What was the inspiration behind starting Hoovu?  As I understood flowers better than others, somehow, I knew what I would be doing would be something to do with flowers.  One day when I came home, my mother happened to be doing her daily puja. And she uses a lot of flowers for her puja. You can say, that was the Aha! moment. It was like, 'Oh my God, flowers can be used this way too'!  Suddenly it dawned on me that it was the most common way to use flowers in India.  Whenever we think of flower business, images of bouquets, wedding decor, etc come to our mind. We never think of puja flowers as nobody has portrayed flowers as part of puja business before though these flowers are there everywhere. And Indians do puja every day.  I really got excited. From then on, Rhea and I started researching on the puja flower industry.  That was how our business started.  Why did you decide to name your venture, Hoovu, the Kannada word for flower?  Rhea and I were brainstorming a lot on a name, finally it was she who came up with the name. She asked me, why not Hoovu?  We wanted to have a south Indian brand that would be there all across the country. We also wanted to pay homage to the city we come from. Above all, we tend to think of puja in our native language.  Were you also sure that you and your sister would start the business together?  Actually, we weren't.  When I started the business Rhea was still in college. But she helped me in many things like setting up the Web site. In fact, she was my go-to person for everything; both for emotional support and actual support. She was the person with whom I brainstormed all the time.  I would say, she was helping me like a good sister would!  As the idea started formulating, she was ready to graduate from college. Then I asked her whether she would join me, and she said, yes.  What was your business plan, just to sell puja flowers?  My plan was to create a captive brand around puja flowers.  Usually when you think of flowers and puja, you are worried about getting good quality flowers, going to the market, bargaining with the vendors, etc.  Regardless of how people pray or to which God people pray, puja is supposed to be a meditative experience. But the process to prepare for it is sadly, stressful and toxic in a way. And we wanted to remove that stress and make everything about puja a beautiful experience.  To make the journey of flowers from the farm to the puja room a beautiful experience, we knew we had to join hands with the farmers so that flowers travelled straight from the farm to the puja room without getting damaged.  Since we came from the flowers supply chain background, we could work with a lot of farmers. That was how, we could ensure",UTC

The finance ministry will come out with the guidelines on the proposed angel tax next month to clarify how the tax will be levied and will also provide valuation guidelines. However, there will be no rethink on the Budget proposal to make the levy applicable to non-residents as well. A person familiar with the development said that genuine startups registered with the department for the promotion of industry and internal trade will not be impacted. Valuation rules on how the investment will be calculated will also be issued. The objective is not to hurt genuine businesses but only to ensure that those people who are trying to evade taxes come under the tax net. Valuation guidelines are necessary as the Income Tax Act and the Foreign Exchange Management Act value such investments using different methodologies.  In some more economic news, As the Reserve Bank of India gears up for its next Monetary Policy Committee meeting in April, experts weigh in if the central bank will announce another interest rate hike following February’s CPI inflation print of 6.4% – the second straight month of retail inflation persisting way above RBI’s tolerance zone. The core inflation number came in at 6.3%, remaining concerningly sticky, while both numbers are above the RBI’s upper tolerance of 6%. According to Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist, CareEdge, the possibility of another 25-bps rate hike by RBI in the April meeting cannot be ruled out due to elevated core inflation, which has remained sticky at 6.3%. She added that it may take time before the moderation in core inflation in response to the monetary tightening so far and fizzling out of pent-up demand.  On to banking matters. With no hope of revival or privatisation, the government will likely close the 75-year-old non-banking finance company IFCI Ltd after addressing its asset-liability mismatch. The government has been infusing equity for the last several years into the loss-making NBFC. After infusing Rs 100 crore in September 2022, it has again put another Rs 400 crore in IFCI last week to help it meet capital adequacy norms and prepay some of the subordinate bonds. An official told FE that an assessment is being done on how much government support is required to cover the asset-liability mismatch. The bondholders have to be paid back prematurely. The Board of Directors of IFCI would meet on March 28 to consider premature redemption of subordinate bonds worth Rs 95 crore maturing by 2026-2032 subject to the consent of the bondholders.  In another development, The Central government has appointed Deepak Mohanty, a former whole-time member of the Pension Fund Regulatory & Development Authority, as the new Chairperson of the PFRDA. It also appointed Mamta Shankar, an Indian Economic Service Officer (1993) to the post of Whole-Time Member (Economics) in PFRDA. PFRDA regulates the National Pension System which is mandatory for the Central government staff joining service since 2004. Most state governments have also made it mandatory for their staff to join the service since 2004 or 2005. Later, corporates and the general public were allowed to subscribe to NPS. Mohanty, also a former executive director of the Reserve Bank of India, will hold the top PFRDA post till attaining the age of 65 years or until further orders, whichever is earlier.  Next up, Industry. Life Insurance Corporation this week said it has sold 2 per cent of its equity stake in state-owned NMDC, taking its total shareholding in the public sector unit to 11.69 per cent as of March 14, a PTI report said. In a regulatory filing, LIC said its holding in NMDC has decreased from 13.69 per cent to 11.69 per cent during the period between December 29, 2022, and March 14, 2023, at an average price of Rs 119.37 a share. The sale of a 2 per cent stake or a little over 5.88 crore shares in the open market","has fetched over Rs 700 crore to LIC. LIC said, quote, “Corporation’s shareholding in NMDC Ltd has diluted from 40,14,72,157 to 34,25,97,574 equity shares decreasing its shareholding from 13.699 per cent to 11.690 per cent of the paid-up capital of the said company,” unquote.  Lastly, Coal India Ltd., which accounts for about four-fifths of the nation’s output fuel, is aiming to boost supplies to power plants this summer as unusually hot weather drives electricity demand, reported Bloomberg. The state-run miner is increasing coal output and building stockpiles at its mines this month to meet supply commitments, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Electricity consumption is set to jump with India’s weather officials predicting another round of scorching heat waves, which could put the power system under severe strain and threaten food supplies. The country experienced its hottest February in more than a century last month, pushing electricity demand to near-record levels. Peak power demand is forecast to hit a new high in April.",UTC

Chief Minister Prem Singh Golay, in his address, said the population of Sikkim is aspirational towards startups.  He said, ""We have a population that is aspirational. A population that wants to be a part of the narrative where innovation, digitization, technological disruptions, and bridging gaps through technological interventions have the potential to leapfrog the economy into greater heights. What we need is local entrepreneurship, their faith in their ideas and those being converted to entities, risk-taking, and finally becoming reasonably strong in absorbing risks. The government startup ecosystem would be best to do the role of initial mentorship, proposing these ventures to financial institutions with a part of funds being provided upfront as initial seed capital.""  Golay said, ""There have been major hurdles despite the creation of a favourable ecosystem with only 9 start-ups registered with the Department of Industrial Policy and Internal trade. The people of Sikkim are in a way first generation entrepreneurs, lacking not only the ideas but abilities to take risks and find support infrastructure of finance and marketing and get themselves affiliated to the organic chain of value addition. It is important to overcome the setbacks by ensuring that our entrepreneurs are provided with the confidence and appropriate support from the government.""  The state is committed to building an agile and conducive environment where industry and businesses can support each other, Golay said, urging the delegates to smoothen, facilitate and handhold the State machinery for bringing in the infrastructure and enabling mechanisms needed to support through our startups.  ""We wish to be part of the narrative where our private sector has innovated, competed on a Global stage and also learn from the vast wealth of knowledge the nation's Startup ecosystem has amassed,"" he added.  He further said the state is committed to enabling the startups of today to be the future of conglomerates that will thrive under Sustainable Development Goals and bring ""constant technological advancements in the field of health and nutrition, sustainable tourism and wellness, climate change mitigation, education, sanitation, organic farming and agriculture, gender equality and inclusivity among others"".  On scope for the aggregators, Golay said, ""Sikkim has significant scope for aggregators in the field of developing an end-to-end chain of aggregation, branding, processing, and supply of organic farm and livestock products and medicinal plants. In tourism, there are ample opportunities like an end-to-end chain from transportation, homestays, sightseeing, trekking and overall holistic tour organisation"".  He said Sikkim was the first State to ban single-use plastic and to be declared the first Organic State in India in 2016.  He said, "" has not been new to our small state, Sikkim was the first State to ban single-use plastic, the first State in the country that was declared the first Organic State in India in 2016. When the world was waking up to the concept of Organic farming. Where through natural and indigenous processes have been applied and implemented in the conversion of our farmlands into organically thriving",natural ecosystems.

So, seize this opportunity to grow your social media handle. This year, we can expect influencers to engage more in long-term partnerships with beauty, fashion, and a whole lot of other brands. This is beneficial for both parties. Moreover, one way to gain the trust of brands, as well as the viewers, is through authentic and honest product-promotion reels or posts. Your audience believes in you and your opinions, so be genuine with them at every level. Keep it real and filter-free: The audience no longer wants to see their favourite influencers all glammed up 24/7, shooting content at high-end locations. They wish to get a glimpse of the real you, your humble dwellings, and connect with your unfiltered version. Your content should make them say things like “How are we all so similar?”; “I want to do exactly this right now”; “Ah! Even my parents don’t let me do that” or “Hey girl, that’s so true”.

With just a click of a button, we can do the things our parents could barely imagine in the ’80s, ’90s or even during the early 2000s.Today, by scrolling through a few reels on Instagram, you can find a GenZ influencer explaining how to do away with anxiety, how to become experts in data science, how to provide the best care to your skin, from where to get the most stylish clothing, how to deal with your rigid boss…. The list goes on. In short, not a single concern goes unheard on social media, and this is exactly what young individuals are monetising on. Above all, they have very smartly aced the idea of generating relatable content. This means they know what the viewers want to hear and see. And we all can agree that relatability is the key to reaching the masses in India or anywhere around the world.Now, let’s understand this – GenZs are not just using social media to accelerate their online presence. They want to transform their content into a sustainable way of making money. Needless to say, this is by far the most entrepreneurial generation.However, their vision of establishing a business is a little different than that of their predecessors. They are not creating any special products to entertain the consumers. Rather, they are converting their own identity into an irreplaceable brand. In simple words, they plan to make money from the content shared online on social media platforms.According to a survey conducted by Adobe Inc in 2022 that covered more than 9,000 influencers and creators across nine countries, about 45% of GenZ creators (born after 1997) who were surveyed said that they wanted to become business owners and make money by generating online content. These surveyed influencers said they have a following of more than 5,000 on their primary social","media platforms.Do you also wonder if it is actually possible to earn thousands to lakhs a month just by uploading comic, informative, or therapeutic short clips or reels? If you do, you are not alone, because that’s the dilemma of every layperson who is addicted to social media but still finds it hard to comprehend its money-making angle.To begin with, influencing is no longer just a passion or hobby. Those who are masters of this art know very well that it’s worth ditching your conventional 9am-to-5pm setup. However, in the current highly competitive market, it’s not at all easy to create a loyal fanbase overnight. It takes hours of labour to produce content that is short, crisp, relatable and impactful. Mind you, when we say short it means that the content should be 15-30 seconds long. Besides, as the interests of viewers continue to evolve, you are expected to refine your content accordingly.Now comes the question “how do they get paid?”. Earlier, influencers used to generate money primarily through YouTube and Facebook. These platforms offered them money based on the number of views each video generated. However, in 2020, Instagram completely overtook the others by launching Reels in India after the TikTok app was banned. Since then, it has been offering multiple cash-generating modes on its app to influencers. On Instagram, creators can earn money through IGTV ads, badges, branded content, affiliate marketing, sponsored content, fan membership or by becoming consultants.According to experts, the influencer market is divided into 4 distinct categories based on the number of followers they have — nano (1,000-10,000 followers), micro (10,000-100,000), macro (100,000-1 million) and mega (over 1 million followers).Although it’s not possible to know the exact revenue of each category of influencers, recent reports claim that any influencer can make Rs 5,000 to Rs 3 lakh and more per post, depending on a plethora of factors. These may include:So, if you want to expand your reach, make sure you don’t pretend. Let yourself shine through your imperfections. The famous Kaushal brothers (Vishnu Kaushal and Govind Kaushal) offer you just that and more. They post such fun, filter-free and relatable content that makes us laugh. And, they do all that just from different corners of their house.3.It has been said time and again that uploading content on a regular basis can help you retain your target audience. However, we also can’t deny the fact that even influencers have mental breakdowns and suffer from days when it’s not easy to appear on camera and interact with the audience. For such phases, it’s advisable to pick something from your phone’s stock.It could be you simply stepping out to enjoy a cup of coffee, making an evening snack, watching the sunset or going for a walk. In short, videos where you don’t have to speak or interact but the aesthetics are enough to keep the audience engaged. Also, nowadays, it’s very normal for influencers to share life updates with their followers, or talk about why they will prioritise their mental health for the next few days.The Indian influencer industry is only going to grow in the coming years. According to reports, it is predicted to be valued at Rs 2,200 crore by the end of 2025. Whether you are a GenZ, millennial or Generation X, the influencer market is flooded with woke and inclusive individuals. So there is room for everyone. It doesn’t cater to any specific age bracket. While GenZs are the youngest to establish their own successful empires through social media, we also know of many millennials who have made it big through the same path.So, now the question is how you as an individual can plan to make a space for yourself in this thriving influencer market.",UTC

(Photo credit should read CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images  General Motors is losing ground in China, its top sales market for more than a decade and one of two main profit engines for the Detroit automaker. The company's market share in the country, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% in 2015 to 9.8% last year — the first time it has dropped below 10% since 2004. Its earnings from the operations also have fallen by nearly 70% since peaking in 2014. related investing news Tesla vs. BYD: Market pros pick their favorite electric vehicle giant The coronavirus pandemic, which originated in China, is partially to blame. However, the declines started years before the global health crisis and are growing increasingly more complex amid rising economic and political tensions between the U.S. and China. There's also growing competition from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism and a generational shift in consumer perceptions regarding the automotive industry and electric vehicles.  Take, for example, Will Sundin, a 34-year-old science teacher who told CNBC he never envisioned buying a Chinese-branded vehicle when he moved to the country in 2011. More recently Sundin purchased a Nio ET7 electric vehicle as his daily driver in Changsha, the capital city of China's Hunan Province. ""I wanted something big and comfortable, but I also wanted something that was a bit quick,"" he said. ""I like the look of it."" Sundin, who moonlights as a YouTube car reviewer, knows the Chinese vehicle industry well. He purchased his Nio over models from rival Chinese automakers Xpeng , Li Auto and IM Motors. He said the vehicle's ability to swap out the battery for a fresh one, rather than recharging, ""put it ahead pretty quickly."" Not on his consideration list? American brands such as GM's Cadillac and Buick, which initially led the automaker's growth in China. ""Cadillac has a good image in China, but it's expensive,"" said Sundin, who previously owned a 2012 Ford Focus. ""I think the problem they face is that they have competition, new competition, a lot of new competition, from different directions that they weren't expecting.""  Will Sundin, who lives in Changsha and is standing in front of his new Nio ET7 electric vehicle. Source: Will Sundin  That competition is increasingly becoming a problem for GM, which has acknowledged such issues with its Chinese business. However, the company has not offered much assurance on how to reverse the trend other than the promise of new EVs and a new business unit called The Durant Guild that will import pricy vehicles with high margins from the U.S. to China. While many U.S. brands aren't performing well in China, GM's decline is especially notable. GM's operations in the country are much larger than those of its crosstown rival Ford Motor, for example. It also has a much smaller footprint globally after shedding its European operations and shuttering operations elsewhere to largely focus on North America, China and, to a lesser extent, South America. Being overly reliant on only a few markets can be risky. But it has led to record earnings for GM, as the company under CEO Mary Barra has done away with underperforming operations. Electric vehicles could be a new opportunity for GM to grow globally, but experts say it would be an uphill battle compared with recovering in China in the years to come. ""With the changes that they put in place, with a refocus on North America and China, the pull out of Europe, essentially, that does create a risky scenario now that you have some issues, multiple","issues, going on in the Chinese market,"" said Jeff Schuster, executive vice president of LMC Automotive, a GlobalData company.  Downplaying results  GM has been downplaying the role of its operations in China in recent quarters, including CFO Paul Jacobson saying China is ""not decisive"" to GM's financial performance when he discussed earnings in October. Barra said in December that China is an important part of GM's business but that the company also is paying attention to other issues, which then included the government's now-defunct ""zero Covid"" policy and recent protests. ""We still see opportunity there ... obviously, we also watch the geopolitical situation. We can't operate in a vacuum,"" she said during an Automotive Press Association meeting. ""But we continue to see opportunity there and we'll continue to evaluate the situation, but our plans are to be in a leadership position in EVs."" A bright spot for GM in China has been its Wuling Hongguang Mini, made by a joint venture, which is the bestselling EV in the market. Since going on sale in mid-2020, the economy car has sold more than 1 million units.  SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co. electric vehicles are plugged in at charging stations at a roadside parking lot in Liuzhou, China, on Monday, May 17, 2021. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images  Still, Jacobson earlier this year said China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and surging Covid cases accounted for the nearly 40% drop in equity income for the operations in 2022. GM reports its earnings from China as equity income because the country mandates joint ventures for non-Chinese automakers — other than Tesla, which was granted an exemption. GM has 10 joint ventures, two wholly owned foreign enterprises and more than 58,000 employees in China. Its brands include Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet, Wuling and Baojun. ""We see a lot of Covid cases in China right now that slowed down the consumer. So we expect it'll be a little bit of a slow buildup but hopefully, working its way back up to levels that we're used to over time,"" he told reporters on Jan. 31 during an earnings call.  Not just Covid  But it's not just related to the pandemic. Equity income from GM's Chinese operations and joint ventures has fallen 67% since its peak of more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015. That includes a decline of about 45% from then to 2019 — prior to the coronavirus crippling China's economy and vehicle production. In 2022, GM's Chinese operations garnered equity income of $677 million for GM. ""This is not Covid. This started well before Covid,"" Michael Dunne, CEO of ZoZo Go, a consulting firm focused on China, electrification and autonomous vehicles. ""It also coincides with escalating tensions between the United States and China. There's no question, and it's impossible to measure, but it's definitely a factor."" Dunne, president of GM's Indonesia operations from 2013-15, said the decline of GM and other nondomestic automakers comes alongside China's market growth slowing, Chinese automakers becoming increasingly more competitive and the shift to all-electric vehicles — which has been massively subsidized by government agencies. ""They've all really taken it on the chin in the last five years as middle market brands. The Chinese consumers are increasingly buying Chinese brands,"" he said. ""That's a seismic shift ... the mindset has changed.""

A tree diagram that starts with 68 horizontal lines on its fringes whittles itself down via perpendicular vertical lines until only one horizontal line remains at its center. That basic geometry has become the symbol for a cultural phenomenon that enchants the nation for one month each year and entices millions of Americans to participate — turning the month of March into big business for men’s and women’s college basketball. The biggest draw? The storylines behind scrappy underdogs: The unexpected come-ups of a Saint Peter’s, or a George Mason, or a Fairleigh Dickinson can only exist in the format. Casual and diehard fans alike enter bracket games created by some of sports media’s titans, and stake their hard-earned money wagering on them. The legalized betting industry also claims a growing number of traditional wagers. The phenomenon has created an entire subsection of media committed to the month, with “bracketology” analysts tirelessly predicting which teams will make up the bracket before it debuts on widely-watched selection shows. It also represents another battleground for sports gender equity: The men’s tournament still dominates the resources committed to bracket games — despite a demonstrated increase in interest for the women’s competition. Natural Selection After the conference champions are crowned and the automatic bids are claimed, the process of selecting the at-large bids and seeding all the teams begins with a NET — and not the kind that gets cut down. After years of vague selection processes based on rating percentage index (RPI), the NCAA Evaluation Tool was rolled out for the 2019 men’s and 2021 women’s tournaments. NET initially relied on five factors for creating its rankings, later narrowed down to two. Adjusted net efficiency (points per 100 possessions) takes into account the strength of opponents played and location of games (home/away/neutral). Team value index further weighs wins against difficult teams, especially on the road. The selection committee also utilizes the quadrant system — which ranks wins and losses based on location and team quality — to select and seed teams, sorted by NET. The process ends when the selection committees deliver their verdicts to CBS and ESPN — which broadcast them for the dozens of teams and millions of fans anxiously waiting to find out who will be playing and where. The Ecosystem Illinois and Arkansas were both at-large bids for the 2023 men’s tournament. Credit: Reese Strickland-USA TODAY Sports Beyond a sports competition, March Madness represents an entire gaming enterprise generating specific ecosystems for some of the biggest players in sports media and betting. ESPN, CBS, and even the NCAA itself are among the companies with challenges that allow fans to pick every game for one bracket out of 9.2 quintillion possibilities. ESPN’s “Tournament Challenge” attracts people to both its dedicated bracket challenge app and its general fantasy app — which encourages consumers to interact with its other content. “On the technical side, we have a team that supports a very large sports digital ecosystem,” says Walt Disney Company EVP of consumer experiences and platforms Mike White. Bracket game apps consistently become the most popular in app stores in the days leading up to the tournament each year ESPN’s Tournament Challenge currently ranks second among all free apps in Apple’s app store. NCAA March Madness Live ranks third. The CBS Sports app is fourth. Meanwhile, the 2023 tournament is projected to attract 68 million American adults collectively wagering $15.5 billion, per a survey from the American Gaming Association. Within that figure, 56.3 million plan to enter a bracket contest with a buy-in. And as legalized sports betting continues to grow, so too does the volume of March Madness bets. Thirty-one million","American adults plan to place a traditional ​​bet online, at a retail sportsbook, or with a bookie — and three-quarters of surveyed online bettors say this will be their first time placing a wager online. Science of Bracketology ESPN’s Bracketology show. Credit: ESPN The popularity of bracket contests has created an entire subsection of media. After “majoring in college basketball indirectly” at St. Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, ESPN’s “resident bracketologist” Joe Lunardi eventually became the managing editor and owner of the Blue Ribbon Basketball Yearbook — a 400-page book released before the men’s tournament each year for the “junkies” of the sport. His invention of “Bracketology” came out of necessity: Covering over 100 teams for Blue Ribbon had become costly, so Lunardi developed a system for predicting which teams would be in the bracket, thus limiting the number of teams his staff would need to handle. When ESPN needed to fill out ESPNews and its fledgling website near the turn of the millennium, it turned to Lunardi, whose analytical content paired perfectly with bracket competitions that were becoming increasingly digital. “I don’t know that this would be what it is without digital communications and social media,” Lunardi told Front Office Sports. “It’s made it a real-time enterprise.” The demand for college basketball analysis — leading up to and during the tournaments — has therefore become paramount across the industry. CBS Sports’ Jon Rothstein has crafted an entire persona for March Madness on display throughout the year. CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery’s shared rights for the tournament has created an All-Star team of basketball studio analysts, including Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, Candace Parker, Seth Davis, and Jay Wright. Blind Spot South Carolina is the No. 1 overall seed in the women’s basketball tournament. Credit: Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY Sports Bracket challenges, betting information, and media coverage of the women’s tournament are all still inching toward equity. Until this season, CBS didn’t even offer the ability for fans to create bracket pool challenges for the women’s tournament — a situation finally rectified this year (CBS declined FOS’ request for comment on this story). Action Network, known for betting information and pick tracking, still doesn’t offer women’s college basketball as an option (Action Network didn’t respond to FOS’ request for comment). This, despite a growing appetite for the women’s game among college basketball fans. NCAA women’s basketball games averaged nearly 200,000 viewers per game on ESPN networks, the most since 2014-15. February’s South Carolina-LSU matchup averaged 1.5 million, the most watched regular-season game on the network since 2010. Big Ten Network reported viewership records this season for an individual game (Iowa vs. Maryland), conference tournament, and full regular season. After moving from Monday to Sunday in 2022, ESPN’s women’s selection show averaged 1.27 million viewers in 2023 — an 18% increase and the best since 2005. ESPN also completely sold out its ad inventory for the 2023 women’s tournament. Outlets offering women’s bracket games in the past are seeing growth there, too: White says that its women’s Tournament Challenge saw an approximately 67% increase in users last season and a 4x increase overall since launching the game for the first time. “We do it because that’s where our fans are,” White adds. “With the growth and the numbers, we’re seeing real success there. We do have the [TV] rights, as you know, but we would invest in it anyway.” Beyond The Business The excitement of March Madness remains unmatched for one reason: The unpredictable drama of a single-elimination tournament, where one game can mean the end of the loftiest championship aspirations and the next step in a Cinderella run.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) CEO Rajesh Gopinathan was leading an already stable and steady company and transitioning to a new CEO won’t change much for the company or its business, said industry experts and analysts, while still coming to terms with the biggest top-level exit at the country’s largest IT services firm.  K Krithivasan’s appointment as the new TCS CEO is the third major CEO announcement of 2023 at a top IT services firm, and comes on the heels of Mohit Joshi being appointed as the next CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra and Ravi Kumar S taking over the top job at Cognizant (Joshi and Kumar are both former Infosys presidents). TCS, however, prefers to pick its CEO candidates internally.  During his six-year tenure as the CEO, Gopinathan steered the company through the years of the pandemic and then the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. New CEO Krithivasan will have to lead growth in a strong company amid choppy waters, said industry analysts. Prior to becoming CEO, Krithivasan was the president and Global Head of the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) Business Group, a vertical that contributes around 35-40 percent of TCS’s revenue.  Read: Who is K Krithivasan? The newly-appointed CEO of TCS  According to a note by Kotak Institutional Equities, Krithivasan is well qualified for the role. “He handles a large BFSI portfolio of $11 billion, has grown the business consistently, involved in many strategic decisions and was among front-runners for the CEO role.”  “He’s had a lot of success with large deals, productisation, and delighting customers. I think the board was looking for someone who was a practitioner,” Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research, said.  Why Krithivasan?  This isn’t the first time Krithivasan is being considered for the CEO role at TCS, where he has spent his entire career of 34 years. In fact, he was one of the top contenders along with Gopinathan in 2017 too, when a successor was being chosen for the then CEO N Chandrasekaran.  “Normally, a new CEO appointment leads to the exit of disappointed front-runners. While exits are possible, it must be pointed out that Krithivasan was a clear front-runner in case Rajesh ever wished to step down,” the Kotak note by Kawaljeet Saluja, head of research, said.  His career trajectory at TCS has many parallels with that of Chandrasekaran, who is now the Tata Group chairman. Krithivasan, like Chandrasekaran, holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Coimbatore Institute of Technology.  At TCS, just like Chandrasekaran, he learned the business and operations of the company ground-up, having worked in delivery, pre-sales, sales etc.  According to sources, over the years, Krithivasan has built a reputation for being great at execution. While Gopinathan is an intellectual, a brilliant thinker and strategic leader, Krithivasan can execute any blueprint, they said.  Within the company, Krithivasan is also known for being straightforward and understated but having high empathy as a leader. He has the ability to take his team along and build a consensus — a critical quality for a leader, especially in the services business, sources said.  “Krithi has a very strong track record leading the BFSI business and has 34 years in TCS. He will be a very solid presence to take things forward for the firm. He bleeds TCS, and knows the firm from top to bottom, with deep respect from his peers and staff, said Phil Fersht, Founder and Chief Analyst of HFS Research.  “While Rajesh will be missed, I am certain there will not be any issues with Krithi’s leadership — he is very much a part of the culture and this spells continuity as opposed to any disruption for TCS,” Fersht added.  Chirajeet Sengupta, Partner, global technology services, at","consulting firm Everest Group, said that TCS has a very strong leadership bench and Krithivasan is a very credible leader.  “What will be interesting to see is how he shapes TCS in his own vision or whether he simply continues what Rajesh and team have been doing. But overall, we are very bullish on Krithi's appointment. He’s well-liked, well-respected, and well-known by clients. He's been in the trenches. He's been with clients for pretty much his entire career,” noted Sengupta. “Rajesh was the CFO becoming a CEO, whereas Krithi has been a business unit leader. I think that is an important distinction to make when you think of somebody becoming the CEO of an organisation.”  Read: TCS CEO-designate Krithivasan rules out a 'great' organisational or strategic reboot  A note by Motilal Oswal said that given Krithivasan’s leadership of the unified BFSI vertical since 2017, “he is unlikely to face external questions on client relationships that Mr Gopinathan faced as CFO of TCS in 2017”.  Gopinathan’s journey  All the analysts Moneycontrol spoke to had a consensus on one thing, that TCS is a well-oiled machine and will not be impacted by this sudden change. It was the same when Gopinathan took over the reins from Chandrasekaran in 2017.  Though Gopinathan’s tenure wasn’t as exciting as the turnaround story of Salil Parekh at Infosys, he continued to drive steady growth and bring in large deals.  “The six years of Gopinathan’s tenure have been good. TCS added over $10 billion in revenue during this period,” said Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend. “Especially in this phase of growth, where the macro environment has been tough, they are winning large deals; they have achieved speed and scale both. TCS has been the bellwether of the industry.”  “Comparing Infosys and TCS will be difficult. Infosys was a turnaround story and TCS was a continuity story. TCS was already doing well, Gopinathan had to build on that and double the scale. But whatever role he was in, he performed well, and dealt with two crises during his tenure,” Jain added.  Read: How TCS grew under Rajesh Gopinathan’s leadership  Fersht concurred, adding that Gopinathan kept the ship sailing during the worst of the pandemic and oversaw some exciting deals for the firm, especially recent wins such as the Phoenix Group and Boeing.  Everest’s Sengupta said that he has to give credit to Gopinathan for steering TCS through a very turbulent period. “He's clearly created a lot of shareholder value. And particularly during difficult times, steering a company like TCS in the turbulence of Covid,” he said.  He pointed out that Gopinathan had restructured the company, a move that has given mixed results so far. While the intention was to ensure that clients of all sizes got the right amount of attention, navigating TCS at that scale became more complicated, and there has been a complicated transition to the new organisational structure, Sengupta added.  Fersht noted that the company was successfully restructured to “to blend consulting, technology, data and business services to address clients' broader needs head-on with a portfolio approach”.  Read: A day of mixed feelings: Gopinathan, on resigning from TCS  According to Fersht, Gopinathan resisted making acquisitions and remained focused on growing TCS organically, through strategic client acquisitions and aggressive recruiting, rather than taking the firm in new radical directions. “TCS has a strong identity and persona that gives many clients trust in engaging with them, and that has only been strengthened under Rajesh’s stewardship. He leaves the firm in amazing shape and ready for the choppy waters that are coming this year,” he said.  According to HDFC Securities’ Deputy Vice-President Amit Chandra, Gopinathan’s business strategies have been quite good. “He revived the Europe business quite well and gained a lot of market",UTC

""Credit Suisse’s problem is that it does not have a business. Over last few years, Credit Suisse has participated in almost every scandal that's come to light. There is a turnaround under way at Credit Suisse, but it needs investments,"" said Rajan in an interview with CNBC-TV18 referring to the string of scandals the bank faced in the last few months.  Credit Suisse was hard hit by the collapse of US investment firm Archegos in 2021 as well as the freezing of billions of supply chain finance funds linked to insolvent British financier Greensill.  The bank was also rocked by a prosecution in Switzerland involving laundering money for a criminal gang. Switzerland's second-biggest bank had seen fourth quarter customer outflows rise to more than 110 billion Swiss francs ($120 billion).  Rajan has an optimistic view about European banking system on a whole even as 20% drop in Credit Suisse shares led a 6% plus fall in the European banking index, while five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for the Swiss bank hit a new record high, highlighting increasing investor concerns.  ""Other European banks don’t have the same problem as Credit Suisse. House prices may have stabilised but with supplies being low, people are not selling. Fed may not be too rattled if the market falls by another 10%,"" said Rajan, who is currently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.  A pause in the Fed rate hike looks unlikely and a 25 bps hike still looks like a strong possibility as core inflation in US continues to be high, he said.  ""I think in the US, at least for the moment there seems to be a sense that the Fed has pulled out all stocks. Depositors have been guaranteed right up to the largest depositors who typically are uninsured and and second, banks have access to liquidity by using the entire value of their bond portfolio. Remember, there are two reasons for concern in the US. One is a lot of small and medium banks are sitting on unrealised losses on their bond portfolios,"" he said.  ""Many of them holding long term bonds, which have fallen in value with the Fed's rate hiking and the second is, many of them have a lot of uninsured depositors and the toxic combination of these two asset values having fallen and uninsured depositors getting very anxious is what led to Silicon Valley Bank's failure. And what is being attempted now is to reassure both sides, on the one side you can borrow against the full value of your assets and on the liability side, don't run, we've got you covered,"" he said.  ""The CPI report that came out yesterday is not a comfortable one. Core inflation in the US is still going strongly, inflation has come down. But that was in a sense, the easy part, the supply chains rectifying and so on. The tough part now comes bringing it down to the 2-2.5 percent. So I think if the Fed sees that the financial sector stabilises, it may still go with a 25 basis point hike; I think 50 (basis point hike) is off the table.""  Meanwhile, US stocks dropped on Wednesday as turbulence at Credit Suisse revived fears of a banking crisis, eclipsing bets of a smaller interest rate hike in March following weak economic data.  US-listed shares of Credit Suisse hit a recordlow, after its largest investor said it could not provide more financing to the bank, starting a rout in European lenders and bringing US banks under pressure as well.  US Treasury yields tumbled, with traders now expecting equal chances of a 25-basis-point rate hike and a pause at the Fed's March meeting.  At 11:57 am ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 585.89 points, or 1.82%, at 31,569.51, the S&P 500 was down 60.75 points, or","1.55%, at 3,858.54, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 100.00 points, or 0.88%, at 11,328.15.

It called for a significant increase in investments by the public and private sectors to bridge the gender digital divide. It also called for the removal of barriers to equal access to digital technology for all women and girls, and new policies and programs to achieve gender parity in emerging scientific and technological fields.  Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women, an entity of the focusing on gender equality and empowerment, called the document ""game-changing"" in promoting a blueprint for a more equal and connected world for women and girls. The challenge now, she said, is for governments, the private sector, civil society and young people to turn the blueprint ""into reality for all women and girls.""    At the start of the commission's two-week meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said its focus was very timely because women and girls are being left behind as technology races ahead.  ""Three billion people are still unconnected to the internet, the majority of them women and girls in developing countries, (and) in least developed countries just 19 per cent of women are online,"" Guterres said. ""Globally, girls and women make up just one-third of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics"" and men outnumber women two to one in the tech industry.  Bahous told the opening meeting that ""the digital divide has become the new face of gender inequality,"" with 259 million more men than women online last year. She also cited a survey of female journalists from 125 countries that found three-quarters had experienced online harassment in the course of their work and a third had engaged in self-censorship in response.  The ""agreed conclusions"" document adopted Saturday by the 45-member commission calls for equal quality education for women and girls in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, information and communications technology, and digital literacy so they can thrive in the rapidly changing world.  During lengthy negotiations on the document, which has 93 paragraphs, U.N. diplomats said language on women's rights was challenged by Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Holy See and human rights language was also challenged by those countries as well as Cuba and China. There were also intense debates over language on gender-based violence facilitated by technology, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because negotiations were closed.  The final document reaffirms the 1995 Beijing platform adopted by 189 countries which said for the first time in a U.N. document, that women's human rights include the right to control and decide ""on matters relating to their sexuality, including their sexual and reproductive health, free of discrimination, coercion and violence.""    The final issue blocking consensus was Pakistan's insistence on adding a reference to ""foreign occupation"" to the document, and Israel's strong opposition, diplomats said. The reference was not included and before the document's adoption, Pakistan's representative expressed regret that the needs and priorities of women belonging to developing countries and facing humanitarian crises including foreign occupation were not included.

OneWeb, a company backed by the British government, Bharti Enterprises, Eutelsat, SoftBank, Hughes Networks and Hanwha, has launched internet from space services in countries located above 50 degrees north latitude -- Alaska, Canada, Greenland, UK and Northern Europe.  The Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM3) is set to launch 36 OneWeb satellites from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota on March 26, a move which will add to the United Kingdom-based company's existing constellation of 582 satellites.  We are one launch away from achieving global coverage. This last launch with ISRO/NSIL will mark over 600 satellites in space, which is the number needed to go commercially live, a spokesperson of OneWeb told PTI.  NewsSpace India Limited (NSIL) is ISRO's commercial arm which is also tasked to get rockets and satellites built through the industry for delivery of space services.  Weather permitted, ISRO's LVM3 is set to place 36 OneWeb satellites into low earth orbit on March 26. This will be for the second time OneWeb is using ISRO's launch services. The first batch of 36 OneWeb satellites were launched from Sriharikota on October 23 last year.  The upcoming launch on board ISRO's LVM3 will be the 18th launch for OneWeb. On March 9, SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket placed 40 OneWeb satellites in orbit.  By the end of this year, we plan to initiate services across the globe,"" the spokesperson said.  OneWeb plans to launch services in India later this year, subject to regulatory approvals and has already acquired the GMPCS (global mobile personal communications by services) permit from the Department of Telecommunications as well as the nod to set up an earth station.  Other permissions are required to be taken from the Department of Space. We will have clarity on that once the space policy comes out, Lt Gen A K Bhatt (retd), Director General, Indian Space Association (ISpA), the industry body for the space sector, told PTI.  Lt Gen Bhatt said the space policy was in the final stages of approval and was expected to be unveiled sometime this year.  We are confident of the commencement of our services later this year for India and have announced distribution agreements with Hughes to provide services, the OneWeb spokesperson said.  The approvals for private businesses that were earlier granted by ISRO will now have to be routed through the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (INSPACe), the single-window nodal agency for the private sector.  OneWeb is a wholesale provider of internet services through its constellation of satellites unlike the Starlink service offered by Elon Musk's SpaceX directly to individual users.  We offer our network services to telecommunications companies, Internet Service Providers, enterprises and governments to use our high-speed low latency service, the spokesperson noted.  OneWeb had contacted ISRO for the launch of 72 satellites, reportedly at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore, after it had to scrap the arrangements with Russia's Soyuz rockets following the Ukraine conflict.  OneWeb uses a constellation of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites to provide broadband internet access instead of the traditional method of using satellites placed in geo-stationary orbits (GEO) 36,000 kms above the equator.  LEO satellites placed in orbits ranging from 200 km to 1,500 km from earth compared to 36,00 0km for GEO satellites -- significantly increase the bandwidth and reduce latency in space to around 50-70 milliseconds (ms), a report by GSMA Intelligence, an industry body, said.  Latency refers to the time taken by a data packet to be transmitted from a user","to the internet service provider through the network. The latency for GEO satellite networks is in the range of 500-700 ms, which limits their use to 2G and 3G communications.

Once a major breeding spot of rui, katla, pona, telapiya, tyangra, parshe, bhetki, chitol and galda chingri, the wetlands (macher bheris in Bengali) are drying up mainly due to the diversion of wastewater from city into river Vidyadhari.  Developed and perfected by humans over the last century, the wetlands serve as the natural sewage treatment unit of the city of Kolkata, while also promoting fisheries and vegetable cultivation. The Bantala Canal area on its eastern side receives most of the sewage from the metropolis.  ""When the sewage accumulates at a height of 9 feet, the wetlands that house 200 fish farms receive water for pisciculture. For the fish ponds to benefit, this water level should be maintained at all times of the year,"" explains Bantala resident Sudhir Sardar, 60.  If the sewage level is above 9 feet at Bantala station, the water flows to the farms. Conversely, if it falls to 8 feet or below, the water will not reach the wetlands. The entry of sewage into fish ponds is of great significance as the organic matter in the wastewater aids in the growth of plankton that the fish population feeds upon. The biological process also treats the sewage, thereby addressing the issue of water pollution.  ""There were 270 fish farms in the area (approximately two katthas for one bheri), covering about 300 bighas of land and water,"" says Niranjan Mondal, 45, whose family has been into pisciculture in Bantala for over five generations.  By 2002, it had come down to 208 and the latest estimate pegs the number at 200, according to Ashok Sardar Bantala resident and the secretary of Laban Hrad Matsya Chashi Kalyan Samiti.  He said if the decline of fisheries continues, it will affect the livelihood of four lakh people who are directly and indirectly involved in fishing. Today there are seven registered cooperative societies and 30 more unregistered societies that simultaneously function in the area.  Fish from the wetland area caters to the needs of in addition to several other districts of West Bengal, with fish also being supplied to Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and some other states, he said.  Already many fishermen who had to give up their farms are now working as wage day labourers at various places in the city, he says. ""Some are working as construction workers, others as porters in wholesale vegetable markets while some have migrated to other states like Uttar Pradesh or Maharashtra in search of better job opportunities.""  Unwelcome diversion  Spread over an area of 12,000 hectares, some portions of the wetlands come under the jurisdiction of ward 36 of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation, while some are panchayat areas. Several underground canals bring sewage to the wetlands, with the municipal authorities and irrigation department controlling the flow of water from the Bantala pumping station.  The problem began when the authorities began to redirect water into the Vidyadhari. An engineer from the New Town Kolkata Development Authority, said on the condition of anonymity: ""Kolkata's sewage is so toxic that it will destroy the good bacteria in the wetlands. Things do not work the way they did a decade ago. The Pollution Control Board has directed us not to let out untreated water.  ""The sewage from Salt Lake, Rajarhat and New Town surrounding the wetlands flows into three new treatment plants built in New Town. Once treated, the water is let out into Bagjola Canal, which flows into the Vidyadhari.""  Meanwhile, the sewage treatment plant at Bantala catering to East Kolkata Wetlands is in a state of disrepair for a decade now. The redirecting of water into Vidhyadhari even during monsoons not only increases the risk of a breach downstream but also flooding in Kolkata city.  Foul play alleged  Environmentalist Sourav","Chakraborti is sure that the local goons working closely with the ruling Trinamool Congress, realtors and the police have formed a nexus. ""They are trapping poor farmers by cutting off the water supply, thus forcing them to sell off fish farms to realtors. Old-timers say the real estate syndicate dates back to the 1990s.""  Putting the blame on both the CPI-M and Trinamool Congress governments for the poor state of the water body, Chakraborti says no political leader wants to acknowledge that the wetlands purify sewage. ""They just want to encroach upon the entire area because they need money to fund elections.""  Undoubtedly, the biggest gainers from dry wetlands are real estate dealers. As water runs out, more and more fish farmers are forced to sell their lowlands to real estate promoters for constructing multi-storied buildings.  ""These poor people do not understand the significance of wetlands. So, when the realtors offered them jobs and a sum of Rs 6 lakh, they sold off their farms. However, the twist in the tale is that they have not received the money promised, even five years after the land deal,"" adds Niranjan.  One such farmer, Dinabanhu Bera tells 101Reporters that he is yet to get the entire amount originally agreed upon. ""Whenever I approach the realtor with this demand, I am given Rs 10,000 and told to get back later. To date, not even half of the promised amount has been paid.""  Alleging that local politicians, police and promoter syndicates are involved in the scam, Bera says the duped farmers approached the local police several times, but nothing happened.  ""They (realtors) have now built boundary walls on our farmlands and do not let us inside,"" he laments.  Javed Khan, a realtor, told 101Reporters that he bought a couple of fish farms because the area dried up.  ""The fishermen needed money and I got the land in exchange. What is wrong with that? However, if you ask me why the fish farms dried up and where the water went, I will not be able to answer. The state government should reply,"" he clarifies his position.  Amaresh Mondal, the head of Bamanghata panchayat in North 24 Parganas, says: ""I am aware that fish farms are drying up and people are selling them to realtors. However, I do not know whether they received the full amount. They were advised against land sale, but they did not listen to us then. We hope to find a solution to this issue soon by holding talks with the state government.""  In 2020, local NGO Laban Hrad Matsyachashi Kalyan Samiti filed a public interest litigation in the Calcutta High Court on the issues faced by fish farmers.  Last December, the court ordered demolition of buildings constructed in the area. However, police or municipal authorities are yet to act.  ""An atmosphere of fear makes many stay silent. Even if they suffer, they refrain from talking about it. I can name three fishermen -- Rabi Ghosh, Tapan Pandit and Roga Jasmin -- who have been untraceable ever since they approached the police. That is why we moved the court on their behalf,"" says Ashok Sardar.  Refusing to comment on the issue, Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation Chairman Sabyasachi Dutta says: ""Mayor Krishna Chakraborty will talk about this."" However, Chakraborty toes the same line. ""I have no knowledge about this. I will not say anything.""

OPEN HUB, which was launched in October 2021, has been used by some 3,000 people in about 1,300 companies for business co-creation in real and remote environments. Established in the metaverse, OPEN HUB Virtual Park utilizes a human-like ""digital catalyst"" generated by digital human technologies, including three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) and high-definition scanning and motion capture, to create a photorealistic human figure that responds to human visitors. The initiative is one of many ways NTT Com aims to use the metaverse to innovate workstyles, create new customer contact points accessible to all, and to develop services that address problems such as Japan's labor shortage and improve productivity, ultimately for greater wellbeing in society.  The OPEN HUB currently has 400 internal and external specialists, real people called catalysts, that companies utilize for business co-creation. The newest catalyst, actually a digital catalyst named CONN, was created by combining human-like visuals generated by Toei Zukun Laboratory of Toei Corporation's Digital Human Technology with human-like personalities generated by NTT's Human Informatics Laboratories' body motion-generation AI technology and voice-synthesis generation AI technology. CONN will perform tasks traditionally performed by NTT Com employees in real environments, such as guiding visitors in the OPEN HUB Park, demonstrating possibilities for incorporating digital humans in new workstyles as well as contact points for customers.  The OPEN HUB Virtual Park will also serve as an environment that transcends the limits of space and distance. By utilizing the NTT XR Space WEB ""DOOR"" metaverse platform, community members will be able to interact with each other and engage in discussions with the digital catalyst on an ongoing basis.  In addition, the OPEN HUB Virtual Park will be a metaverse environment where enterprises will be able to demonstrate new technologies that cannot be implemented in the real world. Users will be able to collect and use data from real and virtual environments, and virtually exhibit prototypes they create in the real environment to obtain feedback, thereby facilitating business co-creation.  Going forward, NTT Com will work to match catalysts and community members based on communication logs, action logs, visitation histories and other data obtained in real and virtual environments. NTT Com is committed to contributing to social and industrial digital transformation through the OPEN HUB and other co-creation initiatives as well as providing advanced solutions for 5G, XR and robotics.  NTT DOCOMO, NTT Com and NTT COMWARE have integrated their enterprise businesses under the new DOCOMO group and its “docomo business” brand.

His comments come in the backdrop of Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju raising questions over the collegium system.  Justice Lalit, who demitted office as the 49th on November 8, 2022, also said judiciary was completely independent of the executive and while the Supreme Court was ""fantastic"", there is ""tremendous area for improvement"".  Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Justice Lalit emphasised that the collegium system enables selection of judges by a body which is reviewing performances at the ""grass-root"" and the process of recommendation by the apex court body is through a consultative route.  While recommending a judge, not only is performance but the opinion of other judges as well as IB report is also considered in the process and a new regime of appointment can only be ""put in place in a manner known to law"", he said.  ""According to me, collegium system is the ideal system... You have persons whose entire profile is seen by the high court. Not by 1-2 persons but by repeatedly as an institution. Similarly, advocates who practice before high courts; the judges who form the body, they see their performances every day. So who are supposed to be better positioned to see merit of the talent? Somebody sitting as an executive here or somebody who is seeing the grass root level performance, say in Kochi or Manipur or Andhra or Ahmedabad?"" he said.  Justice Lalit asserted that the ""system is geared to have best possible talent"" and not all recommendations from the high courts are accepted as for the duration that he formed part of the collegium as ""judge no.2"", while 255 judges were appointment, 70-80 proposed names from high courts were ""rejected"" and around 40 names"" were ""still under consideration by the government"".  ""We see the judgments. we see the kind of performance over a period of time. It is after that that the five judges of the Supreme Court then consider whether the man is worthy or not. At the same time, we are guided by the advice given by what we call the consultee judges... At the same time, the version coming from the executive. It may have something from the profile of the man.  ""There may be some kind of complaint or some dark corner in the persona which we are not aware of. So that part of the consultation through IB report is also placed before us. It is after that the decision is taken,"" Justice Lalit said.  The former also maintained that it was not the collegium which faltered on non-appointment of senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal as a judge of the Delhi High Court and the fault lied elsewhere.  ""Collegium did not falter on Saurabh Kirpal's case. The collegium did make a recommendation, collegium did reiterate. So how do you say collegium system is bad? The fault lies somewhere else, if at all,"" he stated.  Justice Lalit further shared he did not ""subscribe"" to the theory of courts becoming ""executive courts"", remarking that it was very easy for an outsider to criticize and people jump in immediately to make generalised statements.  ""All the courts are quite independent and you will actually see it in the process. Two matters before me - Siddique Kappan, Teesta Setalvad - both of them were released on bail. Another matter, Vinod Dua, he was also granted relief in the matter. Third one, Varavara Rao, again we granted him relief,"" he said.  ""We jump in immediately to make a generalised statement. It is not so. The courts are completely independent. It is very difficult for the judges and very easy for somebody from outside to criticize,"" stated the former .  In response to having represented Home Minister Amit Shah as his lawyer in the Sohrabuddin case during his time as lawyer, Justice Lalit said he represented persons from","various political parties and to him, it is a professional assignment.  ""As a lawyer I represented 18 chief ministers in different matters... I have represented a number of them. I have not met anyone of them. It was pure and simple professional assignment. To me, it was like appearing in any other matter,"" he said.  He shared that the 2G scam case, in which he appeared as a special public prosecutor for the CBI before the trial court, was his most difficult case on account of the ""sheer bulk of the matter"".  Justice Lalit was the second CJI to be directly elevated to the Supreme Court from the bar.  He also weighed in on the issues of retired judges taking up executive posts without a cooling-off period, saying it ""depends on the individual"" but he would rather ""try something else in another quarter"" and when asked to define Supreme Court today in three words, he said, ""Fantastic court yet tremendous area for improvement.""    ""I put in 32 years into practice as a lawyer... there is some way to give back to society that is why I accepted judgeship. Another form in which I wish to give back to society is to teach law students,"" he said.  Justice Lalit said ""concerted action"" was taken to reduce the pendency of cases during his brief 74-day tenure as CJI.  He also cleared the air around the allegedly unusual Saturday-listing of an appeal against a Bombay High Court judgement on acquittal of GN Saibaba in an alleged Maoists link case, saying the case was posted for urgent hearing following an order passed a day before on a ""mentioning"" heard by another bench.  ""None of those persons --neither Justice MR Shah nor Justice Bela Trivedi (judges who heard the case) -- nor me are aware of the intricacies of the matter (when it was allowed to be listed). We simply listed the matter the next day,"" he said.  Justice Lalit further stated there are certain statutes like PMLA and NDPS that impose stringent conditions on grant of bail and until these laws are challenged, the courts are bound to proceed on that basis.

""But the headlines today are majorly about the corrupt taking to the streets to protest action in corruption cases,"" PM Modi said.  While the country is celebrating the 'Amrit Kaal' (golden era) and is on course to mark 100 years of its independence, Prime Minister on Saturday focussed on the key takeaways of his government in the first 75 days of this year while address the India Today Conclave 2023.  PM Modi said, ""It's been 75 days this year. I only want to talk about the past 75 days of this year. In these 75 days, a historic green Budget was presented and a greenfield airport was inaugurated at Shivamogga, Karnataka. Also, in these 75 days, work on the next phase of Mumbai's Metro Rail project was started. It was also in the first 75 days of this year that the world's longest river cruise was flagged off in the country and the Bengaluru-Mysuru Expressway was dedicated to the nation.""  He added that a section of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, facilitating a faster and hassle-free commute between the two cities, was also opened in these 75 days. ""A Vande Bharat train, connecting Mumbai to Visakhapatnam, was flagged off and the permanent campus of IIT Dharwad was also inaugurated in the first 75 days of this year. Also, 21 islands of Andaman and Nicobar were named after recipients of the Param Vir Chakra. All these happened in these 75 days,"" PM Modi added.  He said the country also witnessed the launch of E-20 fuel after achieving 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol, while Asia's most advanced Helicopter manufacturing facility was inaugurated at Tumkuru in Karnataka in these 75 days.  PM Modi also touched Air India placing bulk aircraft orders with Boeing and Airbus, marking arguably the biggest-ever aircraft deal in the world.  He added that over the last 75 days, the milestone of 10 crore teleconsultations was achieved through the e-Sanjeevani app, 8 crore new tap water connections were provided, 100 per cent electrification of rail networks was achieved, a new batch of 12 cheetahs arrived at Kuno Park in Madhya Pradesh, India's Women Under-19 team won the inaugural U19 T20 World Cup, and the country basked in the glory of 'RRR' and the 'Elephant Whisperers' winning at the Oscars this year.  PM Modi informed further that in the past 75 days, India hosted 28 crucial G20 meetings, the Energy Summit and the Global Millets Conference, adding that more than a hundred countries also took part in the Aero India Summit in Bengaluru, which showcased the country's prowess in the skies.  Further listing the key achievements in the first 75 days of this year, PM Modi said that a link through UPI was established with Singapore to facilitate seamless monetary transactions between the two countries, while the Centre also mobilised rescue and relief for thousands of earthquake-hit people in Turkey and Syria as part of 'Operation Dost'.  Also referring to the first-of-its-kind Indo-Bangladesh gas pipeline that was inaugurated earlier on Saturday evening, PM Modi said, ""All these developments bear testimony to this being India's moment.""  He said while his government was focused on building infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports, and airports, the world is being drawn to the Indian culture and its soft power. ""Today, Yoga has become popular all over the world. There is an enthusiasm and global appeal for Ayurveda as well as traditional Indian food and beverages,"" Prime Minister Modi said.  Citing the twin Oscar wins, he noted further that Indian films and music were also drawing global attraction. He said India's millets -- Shree Anna -- was reaching the far corners of the globe.  He stated further that India's ideas and","potential to contribute to the ""Global Good' -- be it the International Solar Alliance or the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure -- was also being recognised by the world. ""This is why the world is saying today that this is India's moment,"" PM Modi said.  He also noted that many countries across the globe were returning ancient Indian idols to their rightful place.  ""The feature of the India Moment is the promise coupled with performance,"" Prime Minister Modi said.  Further sharpening his attack on the Opposition, Prime Minister Modi said the media, which gained a lot of TRPs covering scams of the past now have the opportunity to cover the action against the corrupt to boost their rating points.  He said earlier, there used to be regular headlines of bomb blasts in cities and Naxal attacks whereas today, there is no news other than of peace and prosperity.  He recalled that earlier there used to be news about big infrastructure projects being stopped in the name of the environment, whereas today, there is positive news related to the environment along with those about the construction of new highways and expressways.  He added that news reports about tragic train accidents are now down to a trickle and the new-age trains, including the Vande Bharat express, hogging the news space and headlines more.  He said while Air India was previously in the news for scams and debt, it was now making headlines for striking the biggest aircraft deal in India's aviation history.

With about 1.5 million engineering students graduating annually, India is a rich source of talent for planemakers facing record orders from airlines as travel surges again after the Covid pandemic. can hire an engineer in Bengaluru, India’s southern tech hub, for 7% of the cost of a similar role in Seattle, according to salary data compiler Glassdoor.  The country has Boeing’s second-biggest workforce worldwide, Gupte said.  “ come to India for the incredible talent in innovation, not just in technology and software, but also in hard engineering and increasingly in manufacturing,” he said at the Aero India show in Bengaluru last month.  Alongside the hiring push, Boeing and are also establishing some production in India, which is pitching itself as a less politically fraught alternative to China.  Boeing signed a partnership with GMR Aero Technic Ltd. on March 10 to convert passenger jets to freighters in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, where it already has a facility making vertical fins, which stabilize planes. The plant, employing over 900 engineers and technicians, also produces Boeing AH-64 Apache helicopter structures, including fuselages for customers worldwide.  Airbus has also been touting India’s manufacturing prospects as it hires in the country. In October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended a ceremony in his home state of Gujarat to mark the start of construction of a facility where Airbus Defence & Space SA and a unit of local conglomerate Tata Group will make C-295 transport for the Indian military.  The nation is an emerging market for sales, with the revitalized Air India Ltd. making a blockbuster order for 470 last month, split between the planemakers.  “The time is right for India to turn into an hub,” Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said at the time of the aircraft order. “India is well on its way.”  A vast pool of educated, English-speaking talent adds to India’s appeal as a hiring ground.  Airbus employs more than 700 people at an engineering center in Bengaluru, and over 150 others in customer services there as well as in the capital New Delhi. India has a “unique ability” to support the company with its skilled manpower, an Airbus representative told Bloomberg, adding that hiring in the country was “not really” coming at the cost of jobs in other locations.  A Boeing representative said the planemaker leverages India’s talent for engineering, technology and research and development. The company has said it plans to hire 10,000 people globally this year after adding nearly 15,000 in 2022, with a focus on engineering and manufacturing.  Still, the Seattle Times reported last month that Boeing will cut about 2,000 jobs, mainly in finance and human resources, but without specifying where. Some of those jobs are being outsourced to Tata’s consulting arm in India.  Gupte defended Boeing’s focus on India hiring, saying a bigger workforce there will help increase jobs in the US. Expanding manufacturing and innovation capabilities in the country will attract more customers and drive up demand for Boeing’s products, spurring employment, he said.  Boeing tests some of its latest manufacturing technologies in India before rolling them out in US factories, which helps improve production efficiency, according to Gupte, who is based in Delhi.  Boeing said in February it is investing 2 billion rupees ($24 million) in a logistics park in India","that will initially cater to local airlines and then a larger network of customers in the region. The planemaker will also set up a support center with dozens of employees for airlines near Delhi.  have for decades looked to India to outsource jobs, from trade settlement to travel bookings. The country is home to about 40% of so-called global capability centers that provide tech, engineering and IT support, according to HSBC Holdings Plc. More recently, there’s been a shift to higher-skilled work for multinationals, including research and business development.  The availability of workers in India at “competitive global costs makes offshoring of certain production processes a very real possibility,” said Ravi Srivastava, director of the Center For Employment Studies at the Institute of Human Development in Delhi.  Israel Aerospace Industries, which has worked with partners in India for three decades on air and missile defense systems, drones, satellites and other equipment, is among in the sector joining the hiring spree.  “I’m amazed by the talent you find here in India. We are hiring new talent all the time,” Danny Lauber, chief executive officer of Israel Aerospace’s India unit, said in an interview. “I have worked in many places around the world, but I haven’t seen such a strong universe of resources.”",UTC

But the exorbitant fees deter poorer students from aspiring for the coveted UPSC spot. Now, more and more state governments are trying to get a say in it.  West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi are just some of the state governments that are running their own UPSC coaching centres — not as businesses but as a strategy to diversify the pool of aspirants. It’s advantage students too — free classes and study material, and teaching by serving IAS officers.  And it seems to be working.  Twenty-year old Diksha Singh walks 2-3 kilometres from her house in Jewar’s Rampur Bangar to reach the bus stop that will take her to the Noida UPSC coaching centre opened under the Mukhyamantri Abhyuday Yojana launched by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh in February 2o21.  “My father is a farmer. Our family cannot afford private coaching for UPSC,” said Diksha, a BCom student of Delhi University’s School of Open Learning. Diksha has been taking classes at the centre since August, using the time saved from DU’s distance learning mode to prepare for UPSC and join the coveted ranks of the Indian Civil Services.  Today, more than 10 states in India are either running affordable UPSC coaching centres or offering merit-based scholarships to the underprivileged.  “All governments want to see more and more students from their state become civil servants, and increase representation. That is why every state is now coming up with such schemes,” said retired IAS officer TR Raghunandan.  While Maharashtra began this in 1976 and Kerala in 1989, states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and West Bengal have joined the trend in recent years.  In May 2022, UP opened two centres with 500 students — one at the Gautam Buddha University in Greater Noida and the other at IIMT in Noida. None of the students has given the UPSC (Prelims) yet, but 40 made it through the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission examination last year.  It’s early days yet, but for aspirants like Diksha, the centre offers a fighting chance in one of India’s most coveted and competitive exams.  Institutes like these are providing a much-needed competition to the huge and exorbitant private UPSC tuition industry that has dominated the market for years with centres such as Vision IAS, Drishti, Insights, etc.  Also read: An ‘affordable’ UPSC dream is taking off in small-town India. It can change the steel frame  Facilities, teachers on equal footing  Five days a week, about 200 students gather at the auditorium in Gautam Budhha University. With heavy bags slung over their shoulders, they walk on the red carpet spread out in the hall towards the blue and yellow sofa-like chairs. It’s an imposing air-conditioned glass and wood structure with digital boards—a different world from the schools and colleges they are used to.  “Sometimes, it’s like we are sitting in a cinema hall and attending some big-shot event,” said 20-year-old Ragini Kumari. The clean washrooms and drinking facilities are a draw. “Studying in such comfortable areas with big windows makes us feel good.”  Like Diksha, Ragini submitted her application when she read about the centre on her college notice board and was thrilled when she was selected. Diksha, who goes to the IIMT centre, wasn’t sure how good the coaching would be.  “Because it’s free, I thought it wouldn’t be as good as private coaching classes. But once I started, I realised that the government matches almost everything to private coaching. From air-conditioners to sitting space, nothing feels compromised,” she said.  But for both students, it’s the quality of teaching that stands out. “They clear our doubts and answer every question,” said Ragini,","a political science honours student.  Getting good teachers is a challenge because states cannot afford to pay the kind of salaries that private coaching centres do. Under the Abhyuday Yojana, the UP government has rolled out free coaching centres in all 75 districts of the state. Seventy of these centres are currently operational and hold physical classes, though a few offer hybrid models. The average student enrollment in each district centre is around 50-100.  Gautam Buddha Nagar district magistrate Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj, who supervises both the Noida and Greater Noida centres in his jurisdiction, admits that they are trying to get more skilled teachers.  “A coaching is made great by its teachers. Information is easily available, but we tell students how to approach it.” he said. For now, 20 instructors, from over a hundred submissions, have been empanelled for the two centres.  Instructors come from “reputed” institutions, said Deepanshu Singh, district coordinator, UP’s Abhyuday Yojana. The platform offers free coaching not just for UPSC but other competitive examinations such as JEE (engineering) and NEET (medical) as well.  Rinku Singh has coached IAS aspirants at Unacademy, Dhyeya IAS and other institutes. Now she teaches at the IIMT centre and earns Rs 2,000 for 1.5 hours. Private coaching institutes pay her as much as Rs 5,000-10,000 for the same number of hours.  “Teaching at Abhyudaya gives a different kind of satisfaction. These kids also deserve a good teacher, a fair chance to run in this UPSC race.” Rinku teaches history, art, and culture.  UP’s Abhyuday Yojana is perhaps the most ambitious state-run initiative in India, but it’s not the first.  Also read: YouTube is the new Mukherjee Nagar for UPSC students. Tutors are influencers  Different states, different models  Most states follow two types of models–one where they provide free or subsidised coaching in government-run institutes. And in the other, they sponsor the student’s fees in a private institute. But it’s the first model that appears to be making the most impact.  In West Bengal, students are charged Rs 500-Rs 1,000 a month for an approximately year-long course at the Satyendra Nath Tagore Civil Services Study Centre (SNTCSSC) in Kolkata, launched in 2014 by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The fees cover hostel accommodation, coaching and study material.  Most of the students come from rural areas like Bakkhali and Birbhum, and could never afford private institutes that charge as much as Rs 1.5 lakh annually. Faculty include instructors from established coaching institutes such as Khan Study Group. “We have an offline centre in Kolkata where 200 students are enrolled,” said Jitin Yadav, course director, SNTCSSC.  There are 26 ‘satellite’ (online) centres in 22 districts across West Bengal where classes are held five days a week. Around 50 students are enrolled in each centre.  States that run their own centres, such as Maharashtra and West Bengal, conduct entrance examinations similar to the UPSC Prelims. Uttar Pradesh does not, but has a set of basic criteria for admissions. The priority is to get qualified teachers, improve infrastructure and attract more students.  Another model adopted by state governments are scholarship and sponsorship schemes for students from poor and backward families. It’s the route Delhi has taken under the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana, which sponsors students from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Caste (ST) category as well as those from economically weaker sections of society.  Instead of running coaching centres, the scheme pays for the expenses of selected students so that they can enroll in top empanelled institutions such as KD Campus Pvt Ltd and Sachdeva Colleges Ltd to prepare for entrance examinations. At the time of its rollout, the Delhi government partnered with 46 private coaching",UTC
