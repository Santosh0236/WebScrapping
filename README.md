# WebScrapping
This Python program is designed to efficiently extract and process news data from RSS Feed URLs. It retrieves the RSS feed, identifies specific URLs within the feed, and scrapes all news articles from each URL. The extracted data is organized into a DataFrame, which is then used to generate a CSV file. Additionally, the program includes functionality to insert the processed data into an Oracle database if required.  

To automate the process, the script can be converted into a batch file and scheduled to run at desired intervals, ensuring timely and consistent fetching of news as per requirements.
